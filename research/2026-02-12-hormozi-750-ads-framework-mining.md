# Hormozi 750 Ads Framework

**Source:** Alex Hormozi — "This Is How I Make 750 Ads" (YouTube Short, Feb 10, 2026)
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/shorts/L_4Stkl_Bw0

## Core Insight

Don't create one ad. Create combinatorial variations from modular components. Ads are made of three parts — **Hook + Meat + CTA** — and each part gets multiple versions that mix-and-match.

**The math:** 50 hooks x 3-5 meats x 1-3 CTAs = **150 to 750 ad variations per week**

## The Framework

### Step 1: Write 50 Hooks

Five sources for hooks:

1. **Winning hooks from your previous ads** — what already works
2. **Hooks from your free content** — what gets engagement organically
3. **Winning hooks from competitors' ads** — ad library mining
4. **Winning hooks from competitors' free content** — what resonates in the market
5. **Platform-specific ad libraries** — Meta Ad Library, TikTok Creative Center, etc.

**Key nuance:** Spread hooks across different **levels of awareness** (unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware, most aware) — or focus on one level depending on targeting.

### Step 2: Write 3-5 Meats

The meat educates the customer on the **offer, product, solution, problem** — or all of them.

Five meat formats:

1. **Demonstration** — show it working
2. **Testimonial** — social proof
3. **Educational** — teach something useful
4. **Story** — narrative arc
5. **Faceless** — no face on camera (text, b-roll, screen recordings)

### Step 3: Write 1-3 CTAs

Show and tell them exactly what to do next. A good CTA tells the viewer five things (not specified in short — likely: what to do, where to go, what they'll get, why now, how easy it is).

### Step 4: Film & Edit

One filming session. Film all hooks, all meats, all CTAs. Edit them together in every combination.

## Relevance to Spark Sites

- **Educational meat** is our natural strength (education-first angle already exists)
- **Demonstration** fits well — screen recordings of sites we've built, SEO dashboards, ad results
- **Testimonial** — we have 4 but need results-based ones for this to work at scale
- **Story** — Grant's journey, client transformation stories
- **Faceless** — could work for SEO/website showcase content

### Hook Sources for Us

1. Previous ads — none yet (first campaign)
2. Our free content — workshops, webinars, social posts
3. Competitor ads — other Lakeland agencies, web design companies
4. Competitor free content — what's getting engagement
5. Ad libraries — Meta Ad Library for "web design" and "digital marketing" in Florida

## Transcript

> Here's how I took a company's ads from this to this. So ads are made up of three parts. Hook, meet, CTA. But instead of creating one ad, I write 50 hooks. And then I write three to five meats and then I write 1 to three CTAs. And these things together create 150 to 750 ads per week, which is huge for Andromeda today. Variety. So here's how. Step one, write 50 hooks. There's five main ways to find hooks. Number one, winning hooks from previous ads. Number two, hooks from your free content like this. Three, winning hooks from other people's ads. Four, winning hooks from other people's free content. And then five, platform specific ad libraries so you can look online and find them. Using these five methods, you'll create your first 50 hooks. Now, there's different levels of awareness when it comes to hooks. Spread out your 50 hooks to cover all of them or just one depending on who you're targeting. Step two, write the three to five meats. The meat educates the customer on the offer, the product, the solution, or the problem or all of them. Looking back at my best ads in the past, I used all five main formats. Number one, demonstration ads. Number two, testimonial ads, three educational ads, four story ads, then five, faceless ads. Try these formats throughout your next three to five meets for your next ads. Step three, write one to three CTAs. Show and tell them exactly what to do next. A good CTA tells the viewer five things, and you want to write one to three total. Step four, film an edit. In one filming session, film all your hooks, all your meats, and all your CTAs, and edit them all together to create your 150 to 750 ads in total.
