# AI Disruption of Web Design & Agency Services

**One-sentence summary:** AI can now build complete, production-ready websites from plain English — which threatens commoditized web design but creates a massive opening for agencies that sell strategy, integration, and education.

## Source Material

**"Something Big Is Happening"** by Matt Shumer (CEO, OthersideAI)

## Key Findings

### 1. AI Now Builds Complete Software From Natural Language

Shumer describes telling AI: "I want to build this app. Here's what it should do, here's roughly what it should look like. Figure out the user flow, the design, all of it." The AI writes tens of thousands of lines of code, opens the app, clicks through buttons, tests features, iterates on its own, and delivers a finished product.

**For web design specifically:** If AI can build full applications end-to-end, building a marketing website is trivially within current capability. A small business owner who knows what they want can describe it and have a working site in hours — not weeks, not thousands of dollars.

### 2. The Latest Models Show "Judgment" and "Taste"

Shumer says GPT-5.3 Codex (released Feb 5, 2026) demonstrated something that "felt like judgment, like taste — the inexplicable sense of knowing what the right call is." This is the quality agencies have always sold: not just execution, but knowing *what to build*.

**Implication:** The moat of "we know what good looks like" is eroding. AI is developing aesthetic judgment. Design taste — once a purely human competitive advantage — is becoming a commodity.

### 3. The Pace Is Accelerating, Not Plateauing

- 2022: AI couldn't do basic math
- 2023: Passed the bar exam
- 2024: Wrote working software
- Late 2025: Best engineers handed over most coding to AI
- Feb 5, 2026: "Made everything before them feel like a different era"

METR data shows AI completing tasks that take human experts ~5 hours, doubling every 4-7 months. Amodei predicts AI "substantially smarter than almost all humans at almost all tasks" by 2026-2027.

**For agencies:** This isn't a 5-year runway to adapt. It's 1-2 years, maybe less. The window to reposition is *now*.

### 4. Code Was First — Everything Else Is Next

AI labs focused on coding first because AI that writes code helps build better AI (recursive improvement loop). That's why tech workers felt the impact first. But the capability is now being applied to *everything*: law, finance, medicine, design, analysis, writing.

**For Spark Sites:** Web design was among the first dominoes. SEO content, ad copy, social media management — all of these are next. The question isn't which service survives; it's what *role* survives.

### 5. The Biggest Winners Are Early Adopters Who Teach Others

Shumer's core advice: "The person who walks into a meeting and says 'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days' is going to be the most valuable person in the room."

**For Spark Sites:** This is your *exact positioning*. Educate, Empower, Encourage. You already believe education is a differentiator. Shumer is saying the entire economy is about to desperately need what you already do — teach people how to use tools they don't understand.

## Implications for Spark Sites

### What's Threatened

| Service | Threat Level | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Basic websites ($500-$1,500) | **Critical** | AI builds these for free now |
| Template-based sites | **Critical** | Zero differentiation vs AI |
| Content Bot / SEO writing | **High** | AI writes SEO content natively |
| Social media posting | **High** | Scheduling + content generation is trivially automated |
| Basic Google/FB ad setup | **Medium** | Campaign creation is automatable, but strategy and optimization still require judgment |

### What's Protected (For Now)

| Capability | Protection Level | Why |
|------------|-----------------|-----|
| Discovery calls / needs assessment | **Strong** | Clients don't know what they need. AI can't have that conversation with the same trust. |
| Local market knowledge | **Strong** | Lakeland-specific expertise, relationships, community context |
| Multi-service integration | **Strong** | Making website + SEO + ads + social work *together* for a specific business |
| Education and workshops | **Very strong** | Teaching people how to navigate this is the highest-value service in the market |
| Influencer / event marketing | **Strong** | Physical presence, relationships, Nicole's network |
| Accountability and ongoing partnership | **Strong** | Someone has to own the outcome. Businesses need a human guide, not just a tool. |

### What's Emerging (New Opportunities)

1. **AI Implementation Consulting** — Help local businesses adopt AI tools for their own operations (not just marketing). You become the "person who walks into a meeting and shows what's possible."

2. **AI-Powered Agency Model** — Use AI to 10x your own output. Build sites in hours, not weeks. Serve 5x the clients with the same team. The margin shift is enormous.

3. **Education as Core Product** — Webinars, workshops, courses on "AI for Local Business." Nicole's academic credibility + Grant's technical depth = unique authority.

4. **Strategy-First Pricing** — Charge for the thinking, not the building. Discovery, planning, ongoing optimization. The website becomes a byproduct of strategy, not the product itself.

5. **AI-Augmented Retainers** — Monthly relationships where you manage a client's entire digital presence using AI tools. Lower cost per deliverable, higher volume, same or better quality. The value is curation and oversight, not manual labor.

## The Core Tension

Spark Sites was founded on building websites. The name literally says "sites." But the essay makes clear: **building websites is becoming a zero-skill activity.** The question is whether to:

- **Evolve the meaning of "sites"** — It's not about building the site, it's about building the growth system that the site plugs into
- **Pivot away from sites as the identity** — Lead with strategy, education, or growth marketing, where sites are one deliverable among many
- **Double down on AI-powered execution** — Use AI to build sites faster and cheaper than anyone, winning on speed and volume
- **Become the AI educators** — Teach local businesses how to do this themselves, charging for knowledge transfer instead of deliverables

These aren't mutually exclusive. But the *lead* matters. What do you say when someone asks "what does Spark Sites do?"

## Current Revenue Reality (From Grant, Feb 2026)

| Revenue Stream | Share | AI Threat Level |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| Ongoing marketing retainers | **Largest** | Low — AI amplifies this |
| Monthly hosting fees | **Second** | Very low — recurring, sticky |
| Website builds | **Smallest** | High — but already minor |

**Key insight:** Spark Sites has already organically evolved past the most threatened service. The business model is *already* relationship-first, not deliverable-first. The website is the wedge, not the product — and revenue confirms it. The strategic move isn't a pivot. It's naming and accelerating what's already happening.

## Open Questions

1. ~~What percentage of current revenue comes from basic website builds vs. ongoing marketing services?~~ **Answered above.**
2. **How quickly are your clients adopting AI tools on their own?** (Determines demand for education)
3. **What does the competitive landscape in Lakeland look like?** (Are other agencies adapting? First-mover advantage?)
4. **What would Nicole's education program look like in practice?** (Courses, workshops, 1:1 coaching?)
5. **Could the "All-Inclusive Package" become the default, with AI making it economically viable?** (If AI cuts build time 80%, the bundle math changes completely)
6. **What does Amber's production workflow look like with AI?** (Where does creative direction live vs. AI execution?)

## Connection to Soul

From soul.md:

> "The more our clients understand, the more they value what we do. We don't hide behind complexity. We teach."

This was written as a business philosophy. Shumer's essay suggests it's about to become a survival strategy — and a massive competitive advantage. The agencies that hide behind complexity will get replaced by AI. The ones that teach will become more essential than ever.

> "We build systems that give business owners control, not dependency."

AI is the ultimate empowerment tool. An agency that teaches clients to use AI — while managing the complex integration — is delivering on this value in the most literal way possible.

## What Happens Next

This research feeds into a decision about how Spark Sites evolves. The decision should address:
- Which services shift, which stay, which emerge
- How pricing and packaging change
- Where education fits in the product ladder
- What the team's AI adoption roadmap looks like
- How to communicate this evolution to existing clients
