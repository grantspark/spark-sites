# 9 Formats for Visual Thinking Models

**Source:** [Verbal to Visual — Make Models: 9 Formats for Visual Thinking](https://verbaltovisual.com/make-models-9-formats-for-visual-thinking/)
**Author:** Doug Neill

Reference for how to visually represent the frameworks in the book. Going for a **hand-drawn look** for the models, while leveraging Spark's Visual Styles core documents.

## Two Categories

### Diagrams (Logic-Based)
Use words and shapes. Left-brain thinking.

1. **Timeline** — Answers "when" questions. Sequences of events along a time period.
2. **Flowchart** — Answers "how" questions. If/then logic, processes, decision paths.
3. **Coordinate System** — Two axes, four quadrants. Maps topics along two dimensions. *(Think: Hormozi's Warm/Cold x One-to-One/One-to-Many, DISC quadrant)*
4. **Venn Diagram** — Overlapping circles showing intersections between concepts.
5. **Pyramid** — Layered triangle building from base upward. *(Think: our 5-tier framework hierarchy)*

### Drawings (Emotion-Based)
Use objects and people. Right-brain processing.

6. **Portrait** — Single thing (person/object) with listed attributes.
7. **Visual Metaphor** — One object's structure applied to a different situation. Creates connections between distinct things.
8. **Scene** — Characters in an environment doing activities. Captures a moment. Can be literal or metaphorical.
9. **Map** — Top-down perspective showing how elements relate spatially. Representational or metaphorical.

## Key Insight

Blend diagrams with drawings. The best models combine logic (structure) with emotion (story). Neill encourages experimenting across the spectrum.

## Application to Our Book

### Framework Hierarchy (Tiers 1-5)
**Format: Pyramid** — Natural fit. Five layers, build from the bottom. Hand-drawn pyramid with each tier labeled and illustrated.

### Hormozi Quadrants / DISC
**Format: Coordinate System** — Already a quadrant model. Hand-drawn version keeps it approachable vs. clinical.

### Awareness Ladder
**Format: Timeline or Pyramid** — Could go either way. Timeline shows progression, pyramid shows hierarchy.

### Case Studies / Client Stories
**Format: Scene or Visual Metaphor** — Before/after scenes showing transformation. More emotional, more memorable.

### The Whole System
**Format: Map** — Top-down view of how all the pieces connect. The "napkin diagram" that captures everything.

## Design Direction

- **Hand-drawn aesthetic** for all models (approachable, anti-corporate, matches "No BS" voice)
- Leverage Spark's Visual Styles core documents for color palette and brand consistency
- Hand-drawn doesn't mean sloppy — it means intentionally human, warm, and accessible
- Each model should pass the "napkin test" — simple enough to redraw from memory
