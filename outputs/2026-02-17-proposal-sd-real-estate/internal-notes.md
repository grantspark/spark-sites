# Internal Notes: S&D Real Estate

**DO NOT SEND TO CLIENT**

---

## Labor Estimate

| Service | Est. Hours | Rate | Internal Cost |
|---------|-----------|------|---------------|
| MLS/IDX Installation (Georgia) | ~2 hrs install + ~2 hrs site edits | Flat rate | $450 |
| Content Support (nav + hero) | 2 hrs | $65/hr | $130 |

**Total quoted:** $580
**MLS/IDX is a flat-rate service** — internal labor (~4 hrs) is absorbed into the $450 price per the pricing matrix. Content Support is billed hourly on top.

---

## Assumptions

- S&D has an existing website (we're adding to it, not building new)
- IDX provider subscription is already in place or client will handle it (we're installing, not sourcing the feed)
- "Georgia MLS" means a single MLS feed — if they need multiple MLS boards, scope and pricing may change
- Hero section update is a content/layout change, not a full homepage redesign
- 2 hours of content support covers menu link + hero update — if scope expands, additional hours at $65/hr

---

## Future Upsell Opportunities (not included in this proposal)

- **Local SEO:** $900 one-time — real estate is search-driven, natural next step once MLS is live
- **Google Business Profile:** $150 — hyper-local visibility
- **Google Ads:** $350 setup + $350/mo — target "homes for sale in [city] GA" keywords
- **Listen for:** Mentions of specific cities or neighborhoods = geo-targeted landing pages opportunity
