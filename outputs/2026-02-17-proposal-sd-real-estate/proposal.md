**Valid for:** 30 days

## Understanding

You're looking to add MLS listing access for the state of Georgia to your website so visitors can browse available properties directly on your site. This means installing the MLS/IDX feed, updating your main navigation so it's easy to find, and featuring it prominently in the hero section of your homepage. The goal is simple — when someone lands on your site, they can immediately start searching Georgia listings.
