Subject: Your telethon marketing estimate is ready!

Hey Sarah!

It was so great brainstorming with you about the 30th anniversary telethon — the 90s theme, the Jeopardy segment with the mayors, the rewritten theme songs... this event is going to be incredible.

Here's a quick look at what we put together:

- **Option A (Ads Foundation):** Ads + strategy kickoff + 1–3 influencers — $2,020
- **Option B (Campaign Essentials):** Ads + deeper strategy + day-of influencers — $2,760
- **Option C (Full Campaign):** Everything in B + expanded influencers + 90s content support — $5,300
- All three options run March through May to build your audience before the big day

Here's how to get started: [LINK]

Or, did you have any questions before we get started?

So excited for this one!
