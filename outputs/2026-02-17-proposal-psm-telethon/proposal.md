# Proposal: Parker Street Ministries — 2026 Telethon Campaign

**Prepared by:** Spark
**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Valid for:** 30 days

---

## Understanding

Parker Street Ministries is celebrating 30 years of Gospel-centered community development with a 24-hour telethon in May 2026. This isn't just a fundraiser — it's a friendraiser, designed to grow your supporter base while reconnecting existing donors to the mission. The 90s nostalgia theme, the live segments, the community energy — you've got incredible content. What you need is a strategy to make sure people know about it, show up for it, and share it.

---

## Three Options

We've put together three paths based on our brainstorm with Sarah. All three get you audience-building ads to drive viewers to the telethon. The difference is how much strategy, influencer support, and content surrounds the campaign.

---

## Option A: Ads Foundation

Paid ads running for three months to build awareness and drive viewers, a strategy session to make sure the campaigns are dialed in, and a small influencer presence on telethon day.

| Service | Description | Price |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Facebook/Instagram Ads Setup | Pixel installation, audience research, campaign structure, conversion tracking for donations page | $350 |
| Facebook/Instagram Ads Management | Audience building, event promotion, retargeting — 3 months (March–May) | $350/mo |
| Strategy Session | 1-hour campaign kickoff — targeting strategy, ad creative direction, three-phase timeline alignment | $120 (1 hr) |
| Influencer Coordination (Light) | 1–3 local influencers for telethon day — live shares and audience direction to stream | $500 |

**One-Time Total:** $970
**Monthly (3 months):** $350/mo ($1,050 total)

*Ad spend is additional and billed directly by Meta. We recommend $500–$1,000+/mo for this campaign size.*

## Option C: Full Campaign

Everything in Option B, plus expanded influencer reach, ongoing content support for the 90s-themed assets, and ManyChat exploration to capture and grow your audience during the telethon.
