## Assumptions

- Telethon date is May 2026 (exact date TBD — Sarah mentioned 24-hour format)
- Streaming on psmlakeland.org/telethon — not on social platforms directly
- SEU is handling tech/studio production — we're marketing, not production
- Video content is being handled by Kyle, John Rockmore, and local churches — we don't need to produce video
- Ad spend is client-paid directly to Meta (not included in our pricing)
- 90s theme assets: we're creating social graphics and overlays, not full video production
- ManyChat is exploratory — Grant still needs to clarify if it "just adds an audience" or has deeper automation potential
- Influencer pricing is custom/estimated — Nicole to confirm scope based on final influencer count
- Content Support hours (20 hrs in Option B) covers: social graphics, trivia posts, countdown content, stream overlays, and segment promo assets. If scope expands beyond 20 hrs, additional hours at $65/hr

## Key Context from Call (Feb 10, 2026)

- Sarah's quote on budget: "Don't give me nosebleed seats but also not cheap seats"
- Internal fundraising goal: $500,000
- 4 sets of hosts across 24 hours
- Segments include: Jeopardy with mayors, cooking with Marcos Fernandez, worship, Bible trivia
- Rewritten lyrics to Full House, Family Matters, Saved by the Bell, Fresh Prince theme songs
- Three-phase marketing timeline: pre-pre-marketing → pre-marketing → final countdown (3 weeks before)
- Sarah is excited about ManyChat but needs more info on what it actually does
- Existing brand assets uploaded to Google Drive folder

## Upsell Strategy

- **ManyChat automation** is the natural expansion if Option B lands — could become a separate consulting engagement ($240–$480) or baked into ongoing support
- **Post-telethon social management** — if the campaign generates momentum, pitch ongoing social media management to keep the audience engaged year-round
- **Google Ads** — if they want to capture "Parker Street Ministries" or "Lakeland nonprofit" search intent around the telethon, Google Ads setup ($350) + management ($350/mo) is a natural add
- **Listen for:** Sarah mentioning wanting to do this annually — that's the door to a retainer relationship

---

## Nonprofit Sensitivity

- PSM is a nonprofit. Be mindful of budget constraints even though Sarah said she has flexibility
- Frame everything as investment toward the $500K goal, not expense
- The "two options" structure lets her choose without feeling pressured
- Do NOT push hard on upsells in the initial conversation — let the work speak
