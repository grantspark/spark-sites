## 1. AI Strategy

**Service:** AI strategy sessions + workflow optimization

**Hook:** Most small businesses are using AI wrong. Here's what the smart ones do instead.

**Copy:**
```
Most small businesses are using AI wrong.

They're asking ChatGPT to write a blog post and calling it a strategy.

Here's what actually works:

→ Map your repetitive tasks first
→ Automate the stuff that drains your time (not replaces your brain)
→ Use AI to support decisions, not make them for you

AI isn't magic. It's a tool. And like any tool, it works best when someone shows you how to use it.

That's what we do at Spark — we sit down with you, look at your actual business, and figure out where AI saves you real time and real money.

No jargon. No hype. Just strategy that fits YOUR business.

📍 Lakeland, FL
💬 DM us "STRATEGY" and we'll show you what this looks like for your business.

## 2. Website Design

**Service:** Custom website design ($500–$3,500+)

**Hook:** Your website isn't a brochure. It's your best salesperson — and it works 24/7.

**Copy:**
```
Your website isn't a brochure. It's your best salesperson — and it works 24/7.

But here's the thing most business owners don't realize:

A beautiful website that doesn't convert is just expensive wallpaper.

When we build a site for you, we think about:

✅ What does a visitor need to see in the first 3 seconds?
✅ What's the ONE action you want them to take?
✅ Does it actually look like your business — or a template?

We've been building websites since 2004. We know the difference between "looks nice" and "brings in customers."

And we'll explain every decision so you understand exactly why your site works.

## 3. AI-Powered Websites

**Service:** AI-integrated websites (Content Bot, automations)

**Hook:** What if your website could update itself, answer questions, and book appointments — while you sleep?

**Copy:**
```
What if your website could update itself, answer questions, and book appointments — while you sleep?

That's not science fiction. That's what AI-powered websites actually do.

We're building sites right now that:

🤖 Auto-generate fresh blog content optimized for Google
💬 Answer customer questions instantly (no more "I'll get back to you")
📅 Book appointments without you lifting a finger
📊 Learn what your visitors want and adapt

The best part? You don't need to understand any of the tech. That's our job.

Your job is running your business. The website handles the rest.

Here's why this matters for YOUR business — you stop losing customers at 2am when nobody's answering the phone.

## 4. Social Media Management

**Service:** Social media content and management

**Hook:** You don't need to post every day. You need to post with a plan.

**Copy:**
```
You don't need to post every day. You need to post with a plan.

We talk to business owners every week who are exhausted from the content treadmill. Posting just to post. No strategy. No results. Just guilt when they miss a day.

Here's the truth:

3 strategic posts per week > 7 random ones

What makes a post strategic?

→ It speaks to a specific pain your audience has
→ It builds trust (not just visibility)
→ It has a purpose — educate, connect, or convert

We handle the strategy AND the execution. You tell us about your business. We turn it into content that actually does something.

No more staring at a blank screen wondering what to post.

## 5. Influencer Marketing

**Service:** Influencer events and soft openings (Nicole's specialty)

**Hook:** The best marketing for your grand opening isn't an ad. It's 20 people with phones who genuinely love your space.

**Copy:**
```
The best marketing for your grand opening isn't an ad.

It's 20 people with phones who genuinely love your space.

That's influencer marketing — done right.

Not paying celebrities. Not chasing follower counts. We're talking about real local creators who your actual customers already follow and trust.

Here's how we do it:

🎉 We plan and host the event
📱 We connect you with the right local influencers
📸 They create authentic content AT your location
📣 Their audience discovers you through someone they trust

Nicole has been building these events in Lakeland and across Central Florida. She knows the people. She knows the landscape. And she handles all of it so you can focus on your opening.

One event. Dozens of posts. Hundreds of new eyes on your business.

📍 Lakeland / Tampa / Orlando
💬 Opening something new? DM us "EVENT" and let's talk

## 6. SEO

**Service:** SEO ($900 one-time or $500–$1K/mo)

**Hook:** When someone Googles what you do + your city, do they find you — or your competitor?

**Copy:**
```
When someone Googles what you do + your city, do they find you — or your competitor?

That's the entire game with SEO.

Here's what most people get wrong: they think SEO is some mysterious dark art. It's not.

It's making sure Google understands:
✅ What your business does
✅ Where you're located
✅ Why you're the best option

We break it down so it actually makes sense:

→ Google Business profile that's fully optimized (most aren't)
→ Website content that matches what people actually search
→ Local signals that tell Google "this business is legit in Lakeland"

No jargon. No 47-page reports you'll never read. Just clear actions that move you up in search results.

And we'll explain every step so you understand what we're doing and why.

📍 Lakeland and Central Florida
💬 Comment "SEO" and we'll do a free 2-minute audit of your Google presence

## 7. AI for Small Business

**Service:** AI education, consulting, and workflow optimization

**Hook:** AI doesn't replace small business owners. It gives you back the 10 hours a week you're wasting on stuff a robot should handle.

**Copy:**
```
AI doesn't replace small business owners.

It gives you back the 10 hours a week you're wasting on stuff a robot should handle.

Emails. Scheduling. Follow-ups. Data entry. Formatting. Reporting.

All of that can be automated — right now — without hiring anyone or learning to code.

But here's why most business owners haven't done it yet:

"I don't know where to start."
"I'm worried I'll break something."
"It feels overwhelming."

We get it. That's exactly why we walk you through it step by step.

At Spark, we don't just set up your automations and disappear. We teach you what we're building so you actually understand it. Because the goal isn't to make you dependent on us — it's to make you confident.

AI is a tool. We're the guide who shows you how to use it.
