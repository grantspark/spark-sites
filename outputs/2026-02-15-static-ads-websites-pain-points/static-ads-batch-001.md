---

## Ad 1: AI Forward — 001.1

**Angle:** Your competitors are already using AI. You don't need to understand it — you need a team that does.
**Avatar:** Small business owner who knows AI is changing the game but doesn't know where to start

---

### 001.1_IMG_01 — Graphic: AI Dashboard Framework

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. Bold white sans-serif headline text reading "AI ISN'T THE FUTURE. IT'S NOW." centered in the 1:1 safe zone. Background: deep navy (#1A1A2E) with a subtle coral-to-pink gradient (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C) accent line running horizontally behind the text. Below the headline, a minimal three-step framework in near-white (#F2F1EF) text: "1. Strategy  2. Build  3. Automate". Top and bottom margins: abstract geometric circuit-board pattern in very low opacity coral tint. Modern editorial feel, magazine-quality. Bright, warm, Florida-influenced, solarpunk style. Hopeful technological future.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop the vertical to extract the 1:1 safe zone at 1920×1920. The headline "AI ISN'T THE FUTURE. IT'S NOW." and three-step framework should be fully visible and centered.
```

---

### 001.1_IMG_02 — Lo-Fi: Entrepreneur on Laptop

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Casual phone-quality photo, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. A woman in her early 30s sitting at a bright cafe table in a sun-drenched Florida setting, laptop open, looking at the screen with a slight smile of discovery. Natural warm lighting, golden hour through windows. She's wearing a simple blouse — not corporate, not sloppy. The laptop screen shows a faint glow (no readable text). A coffee cup and a small succulent plant on the table. Slightly imperfect framing, as if a friend took this photo. Warm, subtropical warmth, Lakeland Central Florida vibes. Leave clean space in the upper third for text overlay.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The woman, laptop, and cafe table should fill the frame. Warm natural lighting preserved.
```

---

### 001.1_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Split Screen Old vs New

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Bold split-screen pattern interrupt, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. Left half: grayscale, cluttered, old-style generic website mockup on a dim screen — represents the "before." Right half: vibrant, coral-to-pink gradient wash (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C), clean modern website mockup with bright imagery — represents the "after." A bold diagonal line separates the two halves. High saturation on the right, desaturated on the left. The contrast should be dramatic and impossible to scroll past. Critical content centered in 1:1 zone. No readable text on the websites — just visual impression of quality difference. Solarpunk optimism on the right side.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The diagonal split and contrast between old and new should be the clear focal point.
```

---

## Ad 2: Education First — 001.2

**Angle:** The more you understand your marketing, the more you'll value what we do. We teach, not just deliver.
**Avatar:** Business owner who's been talked over by agencies and wants to actually understand what they're paying for

---

### 001.2_IMG_01 — Graphic: "We Teach" Framework

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. White (#FFFFFF) background with generous breathing room. Centered in the 1:1 safe zone: bold dark charcoal (#1C1C1C) serif headline (Fraunces-style warmth) reading "WE DON'T HIDE BEHIND JARGON". Below it, three bullet points in clean sans-serif: "✓ We explain the why before the what" / "✓ You understand every dollar spent" / "✓ Your questions are the strategy". A subtle coral-to-pink gradient (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C) underline beneath the headline. Top and bottom margins: soft pink tint (#FFE8E2) with faint decorative elements. Modern editorial, welcoming, warm.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. Headline and three bullet points centered and fully readable.
```

---

### 001.2_IMG_02 — Lo-Fi: Workshop Moment

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Authentic workshop-style photo, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. A small group of diverse entrepreneurs (3-4 people) gathered around a table in a bright coworking space. One person (a man in his 30s-40s) is explaining something on a whiteboard, pointing at a simple diagram. The others are leaning in, engaged — one woman is taking notes on a laptop, another is nodding. Natural lighting from large windows, plants visible, warm and inviting space. Feels like a Cohatch or local coworking environment. Not staged, not corporate. Phone-quality aesthetic. Central Florida brightness. Leave upper portion clean for text overlay.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The group interaction and whiteboard moment should be the focus.
```

---

### 001.2_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Jargon Wall

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Pattern interrupt design, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. A wall of confusing marketing jargon words in small gray text (SEO, CTR, CPC, ROAS, PPC, CRM, KPI, ROI, conversion funnel, retargeting pixel) filling the entire background, slightly blurred and overlapping. In the center 1:1 zone, a large clear space with a single bold statement in coral (#FF6B47): "CONFUSED YET?" The jargon fades as it gets closer to the center — the clarity breaks through the noise. High contrast between the cluttered edges and the clean center. The visual metaphor: we cut through the complexity.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. "CONFUSED YET?" centered with jargon fading around it.
```

---

## Ad 3: Local Trust / Lakeland — 001.3

**Angle:** We're Lakeland people building for Lakeland businesses. Your success is our neighborhood.
**Avatar:** Local business owner who values community connection and wants someone who understands their market

---

### 001.3_IMG_01 — Graphic: Lakeland Roots

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. Deep navy background (#1A1A2E) with a stylized outline of the Lakeland, Florida skyline at the bottom — Lake Morton, a few recognizable buildings, palm trees, simplified and elegant. Centered in the 1:1 zone: near-white (#F2F1EF) bold text reading "YOUR GROWTH PARTNER" with "SINCE 2013" in smaller text below, and "LAKELAND, FL" in a coral-to-pink gradient (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C) accent below that. Clean, authoritative, local pride. Top margin: subtle star pattern or warm gradient glow. Solarpunk meets local community pride.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. Text and Lakeland skyline outline centered.
```

---

### 001.3_IMG_02 — Lo-Fi: Lakeland Storefront

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Casual authentic photo, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. A charming small business storefront on a sunny Lakeland, Florida street. Warm morning light, a few palm trees, a hand-painted sign visible. A business owner (woman, late 30s) standing in the doorway with arms casually crossed, genuine smile — proud of her space. Not posed professionally. The kind of photo someone might post on their Instagram story. Warm golden tones, slightly overexposed sun. Central Florida vibes — subtropical, welcoming, community feel. Leave space in upper portion for text overlay.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The storefront and business owner centered.
```

---

### 001.3_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Map Pin

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Bold visual interrupt, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. Aerial/satellite-style view of the Lakeland, Florida area — lakes, green spaces, roads visible from above but slightly stylized (not a real map, more illustrated). A single large coral-to-pink gradient (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C) map pin drops into the center of the 1:1 zone, glowing warmly. Around it, several small business icons radiate outward (a coffee cup, a storefront, a laptop, a shopping bag) in near-white. The visual says: "This is where we are. This is who we serve." High saturation, warm tones, dramatic but inviting.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The glowing map pin and surrounding business icons centered.
```

---

## Ad 4: Burned by Agencies — 001.4

**Angle:** You've already wasted money on marketing that didn't work. Let's talk about why — and why we're different.
**Avatar:** Entrepreneur who's been burned by cheap freelancers or overpriced agencies and is now skeptical

---

### 001.4_IMG_01 — Graphic: Trust Rebuilt

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. White background (#FFFFFF). Centered in the 1:1 zone: a crossed-out word "VENDOR" in light gray with a line through it, and below it in bold dark charcoal (#1C1C1C) serif text: "GROWTH PARTNER." Below that, three short lines in clean sans-serif: "We explain everything" / "We stick around after the invoice" / "We've been doing this since 2004". A subtle coral (#FF6B47) accent bar above the main text. Generous white space. The visual contrast between the crossed-out old way and the bold new way. Clean, confident, not flashy.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The "VENDOR" → "GROWTH PARTNER" contrast centered.
```

---

### 001.4_IMG_02 — Lo-Fi: Real Conversation

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Authentic candid photo, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. Two people sitting across from each other at a small table in a bright, casual setting — one is a business consultant (man, 30s-40s, approachable, rolled-up sleeves), the other is a small business owner (woman, early 40s) who looks relieved, like she's finally being heard. Papers and a laptop between them but the focus is the genuine human connection. Natural lighting, warm tones, feels like a real meeting, not a stock photo. Phone-quality imperfection. Florida warmth, maybe a window with palm trees visible. Upper third clean for text overlay.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The two people in genuine conversation centered.
```

---

### 001.4_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Receipt Rip

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Pattern interrupt, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. A dramatic close-up of hands ripping a generic "INVOICE" or "MARKETING SERVICES" receipt in half. The torn paper reveals a coral-to-pink gradient (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C) glow behind it — like there's something better underneath the old way. Shot from slightly above, tight crop, the hands are real-looking and determined. High contrast between the gray paper and the vibrant gradient behind. The 1:1 center zone captures the moment of the tear. Visceral, satisfying, impossible to scroll past.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The torn receipt and gradient reveal centered.
```

---

## Ad 5: DIY Trap — 001.5

**Angle:** You started with Wix because it was free. Now you're spending hours fighting a site that still looks like a template.
**Avatar:** Entrepreneur who's been DIY-ing their website and knows it's not good enough but hasn't pulled the trigger on professional help

---

### 001.5_IMG_01 — Graphic: Time vs Money

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. White background (#FFFFFF). Centered in the 1:1 zone: a simple two-column comparison. Left column header in gray: "DIY WEBSITE" with items below: "40+ hours learning" / "Still looks like a template" / "SEO? Maybe." / "Total: $0 + your sanity". Right column header in coral-to-pink gradient (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C): "CUSTOM BUILT" with items: "We handle everything" / "Designed for YOUR business" / "SEO built in" / "Starting at $500". A subtle dividing line between columns. Clean, readable, the math speaks for itself. Generous white space, modern editorial.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The two-column comparison centered and fully readable.
```

---

### 001.5_IMG_02 — Lo-Fi: Frustrated at Laptop

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Casual authentic photo, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. A woman in her early 30s at her kitchen table at night, laptop open, one hand on her forehead in a classic "why won't this work" pose. The laptop screen casts a cool glow on her face. Around her: a cold cup of coffee, scattered notes, a phone face-down. She's been at this for hours. The lighting is warm from a nearby lamp but the mood is mild frustration — not despair, just "there has to be a better way." Natural, not staged. Phone-quality. The background shows a real home, not a studio. Upper third clean for text overlay.
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The woman and her laptop frustration centered.
```

---

### 001.5_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Template Graveyard

**Vertical (1080×1920) — design this first:**
```text
Bold pattern interrupt, 9:16 aspect ratio, 1080x1920px. A collage of 6-8 nearly identical generic website templates tiled at slight angles — they all look the same (same hero layout, same stock photo placement, same sidebar). The sameness is the point. In the center 1:1 zone, one website mockup breaks free from the grid, rendered in vibrant coral-to-pink gradient (#FF6B47 → #E91E8C) outline — distinctly custom, visually different from everything around it. The surrounding templates are desaturated gray. The one custom site glows. High contrast, scroll-stopping. The visual metaphor: your business isn't a template, so why is your website?
```

**Square (1920×1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to 1920×1920. The custom site breaking free from the template grid centered.

**Hook:** How small businesses in Lakeland are using AI to compete with companies 10x their size — without hiring a single developer

```text
How small businesses in Lakeland are using AI to compete with companies 10x their size — without hiring a single developer

Here's what nobody tells you about AI and small business:

The tools exist. The technology is ready. But the gap between "AI is powerful" and "AI is working for MY business" is a canyon.

Most entrepreneurs fall into one of two camps. Either they're ignoring AI entirely — hoping it's a fad that won't matter. Or they're overwhelmed by the options, paralyzed by the learning curve, and quietly watching competitors pull ahead.

Neither camp wins.

What works is having a team that already understands the technology and can plug it into YOUR specific business — your workflows, your customer journey, your daily operations.

That's what we do at Spark Sites.

We've been building websites and marketing systems for small businesses since 2013. When AI became a real tool (not just hype), we didn't bolt it on as an upsell. We integrated it into how we work.

Content bots that write in your voice. Automations that handle the repetitive tasks eating your evenings. Workflows that free you up to do what you actually started your business to do.

One client told us: "We appreciate the time he spent with us to really understand our business objectives and the thoughtful guidance he gave us on implementing AI automations to improve our workflows, freeing us up to interact more meaningfully with our clients." — Sarah M.

That's the difference between AI as a buzzword and AI as a business tool.

You don't need to become a tech expert. You need a team that already is one.

Grant has been building web technology since 2004. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. Together, they bring 20+ years of technical depth and academic marketing expertise to every project.

Custom websites starting at $500. AI-powered marketing systems. A growth partner who explains everything and sticks around after the invoice.

Real talk — your competitors are already using AI to get ahead. The question is whether you catch up or fall behind.

But here's the good news: you don't have to learn any of it yourself.

We've been helping Lakeland businesses build websites and marketing systems since 2013. Now we build AI into everything — content automation, workflow optimization, smarter customer journeys.

One of our clients said it best: "Thoughtful guidance on implementing AI automations to improve our internal and external workflows." That's what it looks like when tech actually serves your business.

Custom websites from $500. A team that explains everything. AI that works for you, not confuses you.

→ A growth partner who answers the phone after launch

Our marketing strategist is literally a Professor of Marketing. Our tech lead has been building websites since 2004. That's not a sales pitch — it's a resume.

"We appreciate the time he spent with us to really understand our business objectives and the thoughtful guidance he gave us on implementing AI automations to improve our internal and external workflows, freeing us up to interact more meaningfully with our clients and our team." — Sarah M.

That's what AI implementation should feel like.

Not confusing. Not overwhelming. Not a sales pitch dressed up as consulting.

Sarah came to us because she knew AI could help her business but didn't know where to start. Sound familiar?

We sat down, understood her actual business objectives, and built automations that made sense for HER workflow — not a generic solution off a shelf.

That's what Spark Sites does differently. We're not an AI company pretending to understand small business. We're a small business growth partner who happens to understand AI deeply.

Grant has been building web technology since 2004. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing. We teach, not just deliver.

### Primary 1 — Deep Ad (~500 words)

**Hook:** Most agencies talk over your head on purpose — it keeps you dependent. Here's what happens when your marketing team actually teaches you.

```text
Most agencies talk over your head on purpose — it keeps you dependent. Here's what happens when your marketing team actually teaches you.

You've sat in those meetings. The agency throws around acronyms — CTR, CPC, ROAS, conversion pixel, retargeting funnel — and you nod along because asking questions feels embarrassing.

Then the invoice arrives and you're not sure what you paid for.

That's not a partnership. That's a hostage situation.

At Spark Sites, we built our entire model on the opposite approach: the more you understand, the more you value what we do.

We don't hide behind jargon. We explain the why before the what. We answer every question — not because we have to, but because an informed client makes better decisions. And better decisions mean better results for everyone.

Nicole Rhea is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. She doesn't simplify because she can't go deep — she simplifies because clarity IS the skill. Grant has been building websites since 2004. He'll show you what's under the hood and explain why it matters for YOUR business.

One of our clients said it perfectly: "I received so much feedback and guidance and a whole lot of value on a FREE call. I connected with them at a workshop they did at Cohatch in Lakeland on Social Media and Marketing, which was absolutely amazing. They are both amazing guides in their areas of expertise." — Holtzberg L.

We run free workshops. We do discovery calls where the goal is for YOU to learn, not for us to close. We build your capacity, not your dependency.

Custom websites starting at $500. SEO, ads, social, AI integration. All explained, all transparent, all designed to grow with your business.

Your marketing partner should make you smarter, not more confused.

Quick story about the worst marketing meeting I ever sat through — and why we built Spark Sites to be the opposite.

The agency used 14 acronyms in 20 minutes. I counted. When I asked what CTR meant, they said "don't worry about it."

That was the moment I decided: if we ever built an agency, we'd explain everything. Every metric. Every dollar. Every decision.

That's Spark Sites. Our marketing strategist is a Professor of Marketing. Our tech lead has been building websites for 20+ years. We have the expertise to go deep — and the conviction to make it simple.

There are 10,000 web design companies online. Here's why Lakeland business owners keep choosing the one down the road.

You can find a web designer on Fiverr for $200. You can use a template builder for free. You can hire an agency in another time zone and hope they understand your market.

Or you can work with someone who drives past your storefront on the way to the grocery store.

That's Spark Sites. We're Lakeland people building for Lakeland businesses.

Grant has been building websites since 2004. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. We host workshops at Cohatch. We know the business owners at the farmers market and the ones on South Florida Avenue.

That matters more than you'd think.

When your marketing partner understands your neighborhood, they understand your customer. They know what a $500 website needs to communicate to a Lakeland audience. They know which Google searches matter locally. They know that your reputation lives in this community.

We're not a remote team working from a dashboard. We're the people you run into at Lucky's Market. We're accountable because our reputation is on the line right next to yours.

"Spark Sites are the best organization to work with to accomplish your goals. They are intelligent, productive and a pleasure to work with in every possible way." — Charles L.

"Grant and Amber are excellent! Highly recommend for cost efficient and streamlined SEO, website and content generation." — Wesley S.

Custom websites from $500. SEO from $900. All-inclusive packages from $3,500. Marketing that's built for small business budgets by people who actually understand what it means to run one.

Your business is in Lakeland. Your growth partner should be too.

Something about working with a local team that remote agencies can't replicate — and Lakeland businesses are figuring this out.

When your marketing partner drives past your storefront, they understand your customer differently. They know the community. They're accountable to the same neighborhood.

Spark Sites has been in Lakeland since 2013. Grant builds the tech. Nicole teaches the marketing. Together they're the growth partner small businesses keep coming back to.

What Charles didn't mention is that we sat with him for over an hour before talking about deliverables. We wanted to understand his business first.

That's the Spark Sites approach. We don't start with a quote. We start with understanding.

We're based in Lakeland, Florida — not in a call center somewhere else. When you work with us, you're working with Grant (building web technology since 2004) and Nicole (Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University). The same people. Every time.

"Grant and Amber are excellent! Highly recommend for cost efficient and streamlined SEO, website and content generation." — Wesley S.

Cost efficient. Streamlined. Excellent. Those aren't words you hear about most agencies.

We believe small businesses are the backbone of communities like Lakeland. We price accordingly. We teach alongside every project. We build things that grow with your business instead of locking you into plans you can't afford.

## Ad 4: Burned by Agencies — 001.4_IMG_01

### Primary 1 — Deep Ad (~500 words)

**Hook:** Every entrepreneur has a marketing horror story. Ours is why Spark Sites exists — and why everything we do is built on transparency.

```text
Every entrepreneur has a marketing horror story. Ours is why Spark Sites exists — and why everything we do is built on transparency.

Somewhere right now, a small business owner is looking at a $2,000 invoice and wondering what they actually received.

The website looks like a template. The "SEO strategy" was a PDF they could have Googled. The monthly reports are a wall of numbers designed to impress, not inform. And the agency? They've moved on to the next client.

Sound familiar?

Here's the thing: that skepticism you're carrying? It's healthy. The right marketing partner won't fight it — they'll welcome it.

At Spark Sites, we assume every new client has been burned before. Because most have.

So here's how we work differently:

1. We explain everything. Not because you asked — because you deserve to understand what you're paying for.

2. We don't disappear after the invoice. We're a growth partner, not a vendor. The relationship continues after launch.

3. We teach alongside every project. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing. Grant has been building websites since 2004. We have the depth to go technical — and the conviction to make it simple.

4. We price for small business budgets. Custom websites from $500. Not $5,000 with hidden add-ons.

"We just had a great meeting with Grant. We appreciate the time he spent with us to really understand our business objectives and the thoughtful guidance he gave us." — Sarah M.

Sarah didn't have to wonder what she was getting. We showed her. We explained every step. She left the meeting knowing more about her own marketing than before she walked in.

That's the standard. Not the exception.

Custom websites from $500. SEO from $900. All-inclusive from $3,500. Based in Lakeland, Florida. Transparent, education-first, built to rebuild your trust.

Honest question — how many times have you paid for marketing that you couldn't explain to someone else?

If the answer is more than once, you didn't have a bad marketing strategy. You had a bad marketing partner.

At Spark Sites, we explain everything. Not just the results — the process, the reasoning, the alternatives we considered and rejected.

Our marketing strategist is a Professor of Marketing. Our tech lead has been building websites for 20+ years. We have the expertise to go deep and the integrity to make it clear.

## Ad 5: DIY Trap — 001.5_IMG_01

### Primary 1 — Deep Ad (~500 words)

**Hook:** That "free" Wix website has cost more than a custom site ever would — the invoice just shows up as lost hours, not dollars.

```text
That "free" Wix website has cost more than a custom site ever would — the invoice just shows up as lost hours, not dollars.

Be honest: how many hours have you spent fighting your website?

Dragging blocks that won't align. Watching YouTube tutorials on how to make your header look less... template-y. Googling "why won't my site show up on Google" at 11pm when you should be sleeping.

You started with a DIY builder because it seemed smart. Free or cheap. Total control. No one to wait on.

But here's what no one tells you about the DIY route:

Your time has value. Real value. Every hour you spend fighting a website builder is an hour you're not spending on the work that actually brings in revenue.

And the result? After 20, 30, 40+ hours — the site still looks like a template. Because it IS a template. No amount of tweaking changes the foundation.

Meanwhile, your business is growing. Your services are premium. Your clients are discerning. And your website is the first thing they see.

There's a point where DIY stops being frugal and starts being expensive.

At Spark Sites, we build custom websites starting at $500. Not templates. Custom. Designed specifically for your business, your audience, your goals.

Here's what you get:
— A site that looks as good as your work
— SEO built in from day one (not "maybe figure it out later")
— Mobile responsive without you touching a line of code
— Training so you can update it yourself
— A team that sticks around after launch

Grant has been building websites since 2004. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing. We don't just hand you a site — we explain why every decision was made, so you understand what you have.

You don't need another weekend learning CSS. You need a partner who already knows it.

Cost efficient. That's the part most people miss about DIY websites.

You think you're saving money by doing it yourself. But count the hours. Count the frustration. Count the business you're not doing while you're Googling "how to fix my header image."

Wesley came to us because he wanted it done right — and he wanted it done without draining his budget. That's exactly what we delivered.

Spark Sites builds custom websites, not templates. Every site is designed for the specific business it represents. SEO is built in from the start. And we train you on how to update it yourself.

Starting at $500. That's less than most entrepreneurs spend in time on their DIY attempt — and the result is something that actually represents the quality of their work.

Grant has been building websites since 2004. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. We don't just build — we teach. Because understanding what you have makes it more valuable.
