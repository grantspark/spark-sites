## P1 Issues — Requires User Decision

### P1-01: Wesley S. Testimonial References "Amber"

**Issue:** Wesley S.'s original testimonial reads: "Grant and Amber are excellent! Highly recommend for cost efficient and streamlined SEO, website and content generation." Amber is not documented as a current team member in any reference file. Using a testimonial that references a team member who may no longer be active is a substantiation risk.

**Where it appeared:** Static ads (Ad 3 Primary 1, Primary 3, Primary 5; Ad 5 Primary 5)

**Auto-fix applied:** Trimmed the quote to: "Highly recommend — cost efficient and streamlined SEO, website and content generation." — Wesley S. This preserves the endorsement while removing the team reference.

**User action needed:** Confirm whether Amber is a current team member. If yes, consider re-adding her name to the testimonial and documenting her role in reference files. If no, the trimmed version is appropriate.

### P1-02: Sarah M. Testimonial — Offer Context Match

**Issue:** Sarah M.'s testimonial primarily references AI automations and consulting: "thoughtful guidance on implementing AI automations to improve our internal and external workflows, freeing us up to interact more meaningfully with our clients and our team." This was given in an AI consulting context and is being used in website campaign ads.

**Where it appears:** Static ads (Ad 1 Primaries 1 and 5, Ad 4 Primaries 1 and 5), Video scripts (Scripts 2, 14)

**No auto-fix applied.** The websites offer does include AI integration, so there's overlap. But the testimonial doesn't mention a website. User should confirm this testimonial is appropriate for the websites campaign, or if it should be reserved for an AI-specific campaign.

### P1-03: Nicole's "Professor of Marketing" Title

**Issue:** Nicole's title as "Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University" is used extensively across all three batches (20+ instances) but is not formally documented or verified in any reference file (soul.md, offer.md, or team documentation).

**No auto-fix applied.** This is a documentation gap, not a copy error. User should confirm the title is accurate and add it to the appropriate reference file (soul.md or a new team.md).

## P2 Issues — Auto-Fixed

### P2-01: Meta Personal Attributes — "Sound familiar?"

**Rule:** "Sound familiar?" creates a "you" + negative state pattern that Meta flags as asserting personal attributes.

**Fix:** Removed 3 instances across static ads and video scripts. Sentences rewritten to avoid direct assertion of user's state.

- Static Ad 4 Primary 1: "Sound familiar?" → removed, rewritten to third-person framing
- Static Ad 5 Primary 2: "Sound familiar?" → removed
- Video Script 11: "Sound familiar?" → removed

### P2-02: Meta Personal Attributes — "Honest question" Hook

**Rule:** Question hooks invite binary "no" response and assert personal experience.

**Fix:** Static Ad 4 Primary 2 hook rewritten from "Honest question — how many times have you paid for marketing..." to statement form: "Paying for marketing nobody can explain to someone else is a sign of a bad partner, not a bad strategy."

### P2-03: Meta Personal Attributes — "Burned by" Question Hook

**Rule:** "Burned by cheap freelancers or overpriced agencies?" asserts personal negative experience.

**Fix:** Static Ad 4 Primary 3 hook rewritten from question to statement: "Cheap freelancers ghost after launch. Overpriced agencies hide behind jargon." + "If you've been burned before" → "Here's what Spark Sites does differently"

### P2-04: Meta Personal Attributes — "The last agency talked over your head"

**Rule:** Directly asserts user's negative past experience.

**Fix:** Static Ad 4 Primary 4 hook rewritten to: "Most agencies profit from confusion. Spark Sites was built on the opposite model — total transparency."

### P2-05: Voice Authenticity — "Something about working with..."

**Rule:** Vague, incomplete opening reads as placeholder AI text, not a real hook.

**Fix:** Static Ad 3 Primary 2 hook rewritten to: "Local teams build relationships, not just websites — Lakeland businesses figured this out years ago."

### P2-06: Voice Authenticity — "rush to comprehension"

**Rule:** Unnatural vocabulary. Nobody says "rush to comprehension" in speech.

**Fix:** Video Script 17 rewritten from "We rush to comprehension" to "We take the time to actually listen."

### P2-07: Voice Authenticity — "workflow optimization"

**Rule:** Forbidden jargon per voice.md tone guidelines. Too corporate/buzzwordy.

**Fix:** Static Ad 1 Primary 2 changed from "workflow optimization, smarter customer journeys" to "smarter workflows, better customer journeys."

### P2-08: Substantiation — "10x their size/budget"

**Rule:** Unsubstantiated magnitude claim. No data supports "10x" specifically.

**Fix:** 2 instances in static ads changed from "10x" to "much larger" / "much bigger" — still communicates the contrast without a specific claim.

### P2-09: Substantiation — "most have been burned"

**Rule:** Frequency claim ("most") requires data to substantiate.

**Fix:** Static Ad 4 Primary 1 rewritten from "we assume every new client has been burned before. Because most have." to "we built our model for clients who've been through that." Video Script 7 same fix.

### P2-10: Substantiation — "SEO from $900"

**Rule:** The $900 tier in the offer is a "Starter website (1-3 pages)," not a standalone SEO service. "SEO from $900" misrepresents the pricing structure.

**Fix:** Removed "SEO from $900" from Static Ad 3 Primary 1 and Ad 4 Primary 1. Pricing now reads: "Custom websites from $500. All-inclusive from $3,500."

### P2-11: Wesley S. "Amber" Trimming

**Fix:** All 4 instances of Wesley's full quote trimmed to remove "Grant and Amber are excellent!" prefix. Preserved: "Highly recommend — cost efficient and streamlined SEO, website and content generation." — Wesley S.

## P3 Issues — Noted, Not Fixed

### P3-01: Bare URL CTAs

Many primaries end with just "sparkmysite.com" without a strong action verb. Consider adding "Learn more at" or "See what we do at" before the URL in future iterations. Not fixed because the bare URL style is concise and the user may prefer it for pattern interrupt/UGC styles.

### P3-02: Cross-Batch Phrase Repetition

Several phrases appear across multiple primaries: "Professor of Marketing," "building websites since 2004," "education-first," "growth partner not a vendor." This is expected for brand consistency but could reduce freshness across a campaign. Consider varying supporting proof across ads.

### P3-03: Video Script Question Hooks

Video scripts 3, 9 use question-style hooks. In spoken-word delivery, questions work differently than in static ads (the speaker's tone creates engagement, not just text). Left as-is for video but would need rewriting if adapted to static.

### P3-04: Creative Variations Length Variance

Some creative variations are notably longer (40+ words) while others are tighter (15-20 words). The algorithm favors variety, so this is acceptable, but the longer ones may need trimming for text-overlay images.
