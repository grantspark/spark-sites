### Card 1: Websites
Custom-built sites that work as hard as you do. No templates. No mystery. You'll understand what you're getting and why.

Strategy and content that sounds like you, not a bot. Nicole brings university-level marketing science to your Instagram and Facebook.

### Card 3: SEO & AI
Get found on Google — and stay found. We use AI tools to keep your content fresh and your rankings climbing.

### Card 4: Paid Ads
Google and Meta ads managed by people who explain what's working, what's not, and where your money goes.

Logo, materials, and visual identity that reflect who you actually are. Amber brings the creative vision.

## Section 4 — About / Why Spark

**Section header:** Why Spark?

**Body:**
Most agencies hand you a deliverable and disappear. We sit down, explain what we're building, and make sure you understand why. That's not a sales pitch — it's how Grant has worked since 2004, and it's why Nicole teaches marketing at Southeastern University instead of just doing it.

Our team combines 20+ years of technical depth, academic marketing science, and creative production. But the real difference is simpler than that: we're Lakeland people building for Lakeland businesses. We're not going anywhere.
