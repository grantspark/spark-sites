Subject: Your lead capture pages estimate is ready!

Hey Kristina!

Great chatting about the lead capture setup for S&D. We looked into how your old Ylopo pages worked and put together two options to get something similar running on your site.

Here's a quick look:

- Option A — 5 lead capture pages with Follow-Up Boss integration — $500
- Option B — Smart pages that auto-generate when you add a new agent (works like Ylopo did) — $900

Both options include automatic lead assignment in Follow-Up Boss. No manual entry.

Here's how to get started: [LINK]

Or, did you have any questions before we get started?
