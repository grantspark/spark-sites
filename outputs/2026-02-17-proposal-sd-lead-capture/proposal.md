# Proposal: S&D Real Estate — Lead Capture Pages

**Prepared by:** Spark
**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Valid for:** 30 days

---

## Understanding

Your agents need their own lead capture pages. Someone fills out a form on Kristina's page. That lead goes straight into Follow-Up Boss. It gets assigned to Kristina automatically. No manual entry. No leads slipping through.

This replaces what Ylopo used to handle for you. But this time, you own it.

---

## Two Options

### Option A — Starter Pages ($500 one-time)

We build 5 lead capture pages by hand. One per agent. Clean and simple.

- 5 agent lead capture pages
- Agent photo, contact info, and lead form on each
- Follow-Up Boss integration
- Leads auto-assigned to the correct agent
- Pages live at yoursite.com/agents/kristina
- $75 per additional page after the first 5

**Total: $500**

---

### Option B — Smart Pages ($900 one-time)

Everything in Option A. Plus the pages build themselves when you add a new agent.

- Everything in Option A
- Add an agent in WordPress. Check "Enable Lead Page." Their page just appears.
- No need to call us every time you add someone to the team
- Follow-Up Boss integration handled securely on the server side
- Works the way Ylopo used to. But on your own site.

**Total: $900**

## Vanity URLs for Agents

Right now, your agent pages will live at addresses like **yoursite.com/agents/kristina**. That works great. Easy to share. Easy to remember.

But we know Ylopo gave each agent their own web address. Something like **kristina.yoursite.com**. If that's important to your team, we can set that up too.

We'd put a service in front of your website that catches those agent addresses and sends visitors to the right page. Kristina shares **kristina.sanddrealestate.com**. The visitor lands on her lead capture page. Everything works the same behind the scenes.

This takes a little extra setup and testing. We'd quote it separately once the main pages are live. Think of it as a Phase 2 add-on.

2. Let us know which one fits
3. We'll send an invoice
4. Kick-off call to align on details and timeline
