Generate all images first. Design 9:16 vertical first, then center-crop for 1:1 square.

---

## Ad 1: Education-First — 001.1

**Angle:** Agencies that teach vs. agencies that gatekeep
**Avatar:** Business owner overwhelmed by marketing jargon, wants to understand what they're paying for

---

### 001.1_IMG_01 — Framework Graphic: "We Teach, Then Build"

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design with bold sans-serif typography on a warm gradient background. Central element: A simple 3-step visual framework reading "1. We Explain → 2. You Understand → 3. We Build" arranged vertically with connecting arrows. Style: modern editorial, solarpunk-influenced with organic rounded shapes and warm lighting effects. Background: golden-to-coral gradient, sun-drenched feel. Place all critical text in center 1:1 zone. Fill top margin with subtle abstract light rays. Bottom margin: small Spark Sites wordmark. Bright, warm, Florida-influenced, hopeful technological future, welcoming. No dark tones, no corporate coldness.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop the vertical to extract the 1:1 safe zone at 1920x1920. The 3-step framework should be fully visible and readable.
```

---

### 001.1_IMG_02 — Lo-fi: Workshop Moment

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Casual, authentic-looking photograph as if taken on a phone at a co-working space workshop. A warm, diverse group of small business owners sitting around a table with laptops, listening to a presenter at a whiteboard. Natural lighting from large windows, subtropical greenery visible outside. The mood is engaged and relaxed — people are leaning in, not checked out. Bright, warm, Florida-influenced. Natural tones, slightly warm color temperature. No professional studio look. Think: someone at the workshop took this photo. Place subject group in center 1:1 zone. Leave clean space in upper portion for text overlay.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the group and whiteboard interaction in a tight, engaging composition.
```

---

### 001.1_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Jargon Wall

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Visually striking scroll-stopping image. A wall of confusing marketing jargon words (SEO, CTR, ROAS, CPC, Impressions, Bounce Rate, Schema Markup, Canonical Tags) in cluttered, overlapping grey text — dense and overwhelming. In the center, a bold warm-colored speech bubble or cleared space with one line of clean text: "Let us explain." High contrast between the chaotic grey jargon and the warm, inviting cleared area. The cleared area should be in the center 1:1 safe zone. Background: dark gradient to make jargon feel oppressive. The speech bubble area: bright, warm golden tone. Scroll-stopping contrast.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the jargon chaos and clean speech bubble contrast.
```

---

## Ad 2: Burned-by-Agencies — 001.2

**Angle:** Empathy for business owners who've been burned — skepticism is valid, transparency is the answer
**Avatar:** Business owner who spent money on marketing that didn't work, now cautious

---

### 001.2_IMG_01 — Lo-fi: Empty Promises

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Casual, authentic image of a small business owner sitting at a desk looking at their laptop screen with a frustrated but determined expression. On the desk: a stack of old business cards from other agencies, a printed invoice, a coffee cup. Natural lighting, slightly warm. The scene reads as "been through this before." No exaggerated emotion — subtle, real. Think: a friend posted this candid shot. Florida-influenced warm tones, natural office or home workspace setting. Subject in center 1:1 zone. Leave top area relatively clean for text overlay. Mood: relatable, honest, the moment before things change.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the business owner and desk details.
```

---

### 001.2_IMG_02 — Lo-fi: Side-by-Side Screens

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Phone-quality photograph showing two laptop screens side by side on a bright desk. Left screen: a generic, clearly template website (cookie-cutter layout, stock photos). Right screen: a clean, professional, custom website with beautiful design and real photography. The contrast should be obvious but not cartoonish. Bright natural lighting, warm wood desk surface, a plant in the background. Florida-influenced warmth. Center the two screens in the 1:1 safe zone. No text on the image — the visual contrast tells the story. Authentic, UGC-style.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to show both screens with clear quality contrast.
```

---

### 001.2_IMG_03 — Interrupt: The Receipt

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Bold, high-contrast scroll-stopping image. A crumpled receipt or invoice on a bright surface with line items visible: "Website design - $2,500" and "Status: NEVER DELIVERED" stamped in red. The receipt is crumpled as if thrown away in frustration, then smoothed back out. Warm lighting, dramatic shadows. The receipt fills the center 1:1 zone aggressively. Background: clean, bright surface (white marble or light wood) with warm, golden-hour side lighting. The mood is visceral — everyone who's been burned recognizes this feeling.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to fill frame with the receipt and red status stamp.
```

---

## Ad 3: Local Trust / Lakeland — 001.3

**Angle:** We're Lakeland people building for Lakeland businesses
**Avatar:** Local business owner who values community and face-to-face relationships

---

### 001.3_IMG_01 — Graphic: Lakeland Community

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design featuring a stylized illustration of a recognizable Lakeland scene — think Lake Mirror with the Hollis Garden area or a warm downtown Lakeland streetscape with small business storefronts. Solarpunk style: organic integration of technology and nature. Solar panels on storefronts, digital signs, but everything warm and inviting. Bold text overlay space in center: clean area for headline. Color palette: golden-hour warm tones, subtropical greens, coral accents. Place the illustrated scene across the full frame with text-ready negative space in the center 1:1 zone. Bottom: subtle Spark Sites wordmark. Bright, hopeful, community-focused.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the downtown scene and text overlay space.
```

---

### 001.3_IMG_02 — Lo-fi: Real Local Business

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Authentic photograph of a small business storefront in a Florida downtown setting — warm brick, large windows, an "Open" sign, potted tropical plants by the entrance. Golden hour lighting. A person (business owner) standing in the doorway looking proud but approachable. The storefront has a clean, professional look. Everything says "local, real, thriving." Natural phone-quality feel. Bright, warm, subtropical. Subject and storefront in center 1:1 zone. Leave sky area for text overlay. No corporate stock photo feel.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the storefront and owner.
```

---

### 001.3_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Map Pin

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Bold, attention-grabbing image of a large, warm-colored map pin dropping onto a stylized map of Lakeland/Central Florida. The pin is oversized and glowing with warm golden light. The map beneath is simplified — roads, lake shapes, the outline of Polk County. High saturation, dramatic but warm. The pin dominates the center 1:1 zone. Surrounding area: subtle city grid pattern fading into soft gradient. Mood: "We're right here." Not corporate cartography — more playful, inviting, solarpunk-influenced.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to fill frame with the glowing map pin and Lakeland map.
```

## Ad 4: AI-Forward + Consulting Depth — 001.4

**Angle:** Your competitors are using AI — you need a team that already knows it, with deep strategic expertise behind the website
**Avatar:** Business owner who knows AI matters but feels overwhelmed or behind

---

### 001.4_IMG_01 — Interrupt: AI Dashboard Glow

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Visually striking image of a laptop screen displaying an AI-powered marketing dashboard — glowing data visualizations, content generation interface, automation workflows. The screen radiates warm, golden light onto the desk and surrounding area. Solarpunk aesthetic: the technology feels warm and hopeful, not cold and dystopian. Tropical plants in the background, warm natural light from a window mixing with the screen glow. The laptop and screen dominate the center 1:1 zone. High contrast between the glowing screen and the warm, natural environment. Mood: the future is already here, and it's welcoming.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the glowing dashboard and warm environment.
```

---

### 001.4_IMG_02 — Lo-fi: Before/After Results

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Phone-quality screenshot-style image showing a phone held up displaying a Google Analytics or search console graph trending sharply upward. The hand holding the phone is casual, slightly off-angle like someone snapped this to share. Behind the phone: a bright desk with a coffee cup and notebook. The graph shows clear growth. Warm lighting, natural setting. No professional staging. Think: "look what just happened to my traffic." Phone and graph in center 1:1 zone. Leave top area for text overlay. Authentic UGC style.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the phone screen with growth graph.
```

---

### 001.4_IMG_03 — Interrupt: Split Screen: Manual vs AI

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Bold split-screen image. Left half: cluttered desk with papers, sticky notes, a overwhelmed hand on forehead, dim fluorescent lighting, cold blue tones. Text label: "Still doing it manually." Right half: clean desk with a laptop showing automated workflows, a plant, warm golden lighting, clear workspace. Text label: "AI-powered." The split runs vertically through the center. The contrast is dramatic. Left = chaos, right = clarity. Both halves fill the 1:1 safe zone. The warm right side should feel more inviting. Scroll-stopping contrast.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the full split contrast.
```

## Ad 5: Academic Credibility — 001.5

**Angle:** Real credentials behind the strategy — Professor of Marketing + 20 years technical depth
**Avatar:** Skeptical business owner who wants proven expertise, not just confidence

---

### 001.5_IMG_01 — Graphic: Credentials Stack

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Clean graphic design with bold typography on a warm gradient. Central element: a stacked credentials display reading "Professor of Marketing — Southeastern University" and "20+ Years Web & Technology Experience" arranged as elegant typographic blocks with a subtle horizontal divider between them. Below: "Your strategy team." Style: authoritative but warm, modern editorial. Background: warm coral-to-golden gradient. Clean sans-serif typography. Place all text in center 1:1 zone. Top and bottom margins: subtle abstract elements suggesting education (a mortar board silhouette, code brackets) in lighter tones. Solarpunk warmth, not corporate coldness.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the credentials typography fully.
```

---

### 001.5_IMG_02 — Lo-fi: Teaching Moment

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Authentic photograph of a professional woman teaching in a modern classroom or lecture setting. She's standing near a screen showing a marketing framework, gesturing while explaining. Students or attendees are visible, engaged. Natural bright lighting, warm wood tones in the room. The mood is knowledgeable, approachable — she clearly knows her subject but isn't intimidating. Florida-influenced warm tones. Casual phone-quality feel, like a student took the photo. Subject in center 1:1 zone. Leave top area for text overlay.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**
```text
Center-crop to capture the teaching moment and attendee engagement.
```

---

### 001.5_IMG_03 — Interrupt: YouTube vs University

**Vertical (1080x1920) — design this first:**
```text
Bold split comparison. Left: a YouTube play button icon with text "Their marketing education." Dim, cold, casual. Right: a university building silhouette with text "Our marketing education." Warm, golden, prestigious. The contrast is stark but not mean-spirited — it's about depth, not dunking. Center both elements in the 1:1 safe zone. Background: dark on the left, warm gradient on the right. The split creates a natural visual hierarchy favoring the right side. Bold, clean typography. Scroll-stopping but dignified.
```

**Square (1920x1920) — center-crop from vertical:**

**Hook:** How Lakeland business owners go from marketing confusion to confidence — with a team that teaches every step along the way

```text
How Lakeland business owners go from marketing confusion to confidence — with a team that teaches every step along the way.

Most agencies operate behind a curtain.

They use jargon on purpose. They send reports full of acronyms. They keep clients confused because confused clients don't ask hard questions.

And confused clients keep paying.

We saw this pattern for years in Lakeland and decided to build the opposite.

At Spark Sites, education isn't a marketing gimmick — it's how we run every project. When we build a website, we walk through every decision. Why this layout. Why this headline. Why this page structure matters for Google.

Not because we have to. Because the more a business owner understands, the better decisions they make. And better decisions mean better outcomes for everyone.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

Our strategist, Nicole Rhea, is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. She doesn't just "know marketing" — she teaches the frameworks that other agencies are still trying to figure out from blog posts. That depth shows up in every strategy conversation.

Grant has been building websites and technology systems since 2004. Twenty years of seeing what actually works — and more importantly, what doesn't — for small businesses.

Together with Amber, our Creative Director, the team brings academic marketing strategy, deep technical execution, and creative production under one roof.

But here's the part that matters most: every website project includes training.

Not a PDF nobody reads. Real, hands-on training so business owners can update their own content, understand their analytics, and make informed decisions about what comes next.

Because a website isn't a one-time purchase. It's the digital foundation of a business. And the owner should understand it as well as they understand their own storefront.

We also run free workshops at Cohatch in Lakeland. No pitch, no pressure — just practical marketing education for local business owners. People show up skeptical and leave with actionable steps they can use that same week.

Custom websites start at $500 for a links page and go up to $3,500+ for full e-commerce with marketing services bundled. Every tier includes the same education-first approach.

This isn't about making websites. It's about making sure the business owner behind the website knows exactly what they have and how to use it.

Book a free discovery call. Even if Spark Sites isn't the right fit, the call itself will teach something valuable about what your business actually needs online.

**Hook:** Most agencies hand over a deliverable and disappear. One Lakeland team does the opposite — they teach at every single step

```text
Most agencies hand over a deliverable and disappear. One Lakeland team does the opposite — they teach at every single step.

Had a website built last year by an agency that never once explained why they made the choices they did. Got a pretty site. Had no idea how to use it or what any of the analytics meant.

Then found Spark Sites through a free workshop at Cohatch. Grant walked through everything — layout, SEO basics, why certain pages matter. Nicole broke down the marketing strategy behind it.

They didn't just build the new site. They made sure the whole team understood it.

Biggest difference: training comes standard. Not a 10-page PDF. Actual walkthroughs so the owner can update content, read reports, and make smart decisions.

Custom sites from $500 to $3,500+. The education is the same at every level.

```text
This Lakeland agency built a reputation for something others refuse to do — they explain everything before taking a single dollar.

Here's what makes Spark Sites different from every other web design company in Central Florida:

Education is built into the process. Not as an add-on. Not as a bonus PDF. As the actual way they work.

Every website project — from a $500 links page to a $3,500+ all-inclusive package — includes:

- A full walkthrough of every design decision and why it matters
- SEO fundamentals explained in plain language
- Hands-on training so the owner can update their own content
- A strategy conversation that reveals what the business actually needs next

The team behind it: Nicole Rhea, Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. Grant Sparks, building web technology since 2004. Amber Beardmore, Creative Director who turns strategy into visuals.

Academic marketing strategy. Two decades of technical depth. Real creative execution.

Business owners who understand their marketing spend smarter, stay longer, and get better results. That's not a philosophy — it's math.

Free discovery call. Free workshops at Cohatch Lakeland. No pitch, no pressure. The education starts before the invoice.

**Hook:** One Lakeland workshop changed how a business owner thought about marketing. No pitch, no pressure — just guidance and real value

```text
One Lakeland workshop changed how a business owner thought about marketing. No pitch, no pressure — just guidance and real value.

"I am so grateful for my conversation with Nicole and Grant. I received so much feedback and guidance and a whole lot of value on a FREE call. I connected with them at a workshop they did at the Cohatch in Lakeland on Social Media and Marketing (which was absolutely amazing). I am looking forward to learning more from them as they are both amazing guides in their areas of expertise." — Holtzberg L.

That's what happens when an agency leads with education instead of a sales pitch.

Spark Sites runs free workshops at Cohatch in Lakeland — real marketing guidance that business owners can use immediately, whether they hire anyone or not.

Behind the workshops: Nicole Rhea is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. Grant has been in web technology since 2004. This isn't surface-level advice. It's the same depth that goes into every website and marketing project.

Custom websites from $500 to $3,500+ with an all-inclusive option that bundles Google Business setup, email marketing, and ongoing strategy.

Every project includes hands-on training. Every client walks away understanding what they have and how to grow with it.

Start with a free discovery call. Same approach — guidance first, pitch second.

**Hook:** A $2,000 website that never launched. A social media manager who ghosted after month one. Lakeland owners know this story too well

```text
A $2,000 website that never launched. A social media manager who ghosted after month one. Lakeland owners know this story too well.

The pattern looks like this:

Find someone online. The portfolio looks great. The pitch sounds professional. They promise the world. Payment goes through.

Then silence. Delayed timelines. Half-finished work. "We're almost there" for weeks that turn into months. Eventually they disappear and the business owner is left with nothing but an invoice and a lesson.

Or the other version: the nephew who "knows computers." A template site that looks like it was built in 2015. No mobile optimization. Invisible on Google. The business owner knows something is wrong but doesn't know what.

This happens so often in Lakeland that skepticism is the default. And honestly — that skepticism is healthy.

Spark Sites was built to earn its way past that skepticism. Not with bigger promises. With transparency.

Here's what that means:

Every project starts with a discovery call where the first priority is understanding the business — not closing a deal. Grant spends the full session learning objectives, asking questions, and explaining what different services actually do. No jargon. No pressure. If Spark Sites isn't the right fit, the call itself is still valuable.

During the build, every decision gets explained. Why this layout. Why this page structure. Why this matters for search ranking. Clients aren't kept in the dark because educated clients are better clients.

Training is included at every price point. Not a document. Actual hands-on training so the business owner can update content, read their analytics, and understand what's happening with their online presence.

The team is local. Grant has been in Lakeland building websites since 2004. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern. Amber runs creative production. They run free workshops at Cohatch. They show up at local business events. They have a reputation to maintain in this community.

Custom websites start at $500 for a links page, $900 for a starter site, $1,500–$2,500 for full multi-page, and $3,500+ for the all-inclusive package with Google Business, email marketing, and ongoing support.

Being burned before doesn't mean giving up on having a real online presence. It means being smarter about who builds it.

Free discovery call. Transparent pricing. Local team. Full training included.

Spent $3,000 on marketing last year with nothing to show for it. That story ends here — Lakeland finally has a transparent agency.

After two bad experiences with web designers — one ghosted, one delivered a template that embarrassed the business — a local owner found Spark Sites through a Cohatch workshop.

First difference: Grant spent an hour on a discovery call. Asked questions. Explained options. Didn't push.

Second difference: every design choice came with an explanation. No mystery.

Third difference: training is included. The owner can update content without calling anyone.

```text
Here's how even small businesses burned by cheap freelancers are getting professional sites — without the mystery or the runaround.

The solution isn't finding a more expensive agency. It's finding a transparent one.

Spark Sites in Lakeland operates on a simple principle: explain everything. Before the build, during the build, and after the build.

What that looks like:

Before — A discovery call focused on understanding the business, not closing a sale. Walk away with clarity on what services actually matter, even without hiring anyone.

During — Every design decision explained. Every strategy choice transparent. No "just trust us" moments. Clients see exactly what's happening and why.

After — Hands-on training. The business owner knows how to update content, read analytics, and make smart decisions about what comes next.

The team has been in Lakeland since 2013. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern. Grant has been building web technology since 2004. They run workshops at Cohatch. They're embedded in this community.

Custom sites: $500 links page, $900 starter, $1,500–$2,500 multi-page, $3,500+ all-inclusive with Google Business setup, email marketing, and ongoing strategy.

No surprises. No disappearing acts. No jargon smokescreen.

Free discovery call — the transparency starts there.

**Hook:** After being burned twice, one business owner found an agency that spent the full session understanding their goals before proposing

```text
After being burned twice, one business owner found an agency that spent the full session understanding their goals before proposing anything.

"We just had a great meeting with Grant. We appreciate the time he spent with us to really understand our business objectives and the thoughtful guidance he gave us on implementing AI automations to improve our internal and external workflows, freeing us up to interact more meaningfully with our clients and our team." — Sarah M.

That review captures something most agencies don't do: listen first.

Grant didn't open with a pitch deck or a pricing grid. He opened with questions. What's the business model? Where's the revenue coming from? What's working? What's not?

By the end of the call, the business owner had clarity on what to do next — not because Grant sold a service, but because he understood the situation.

That's the Spark Sites approach. Education and understanding before everything else.

The team includes a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University, a technical lead with 20+ years in web technology, and a Creative Director who brings the strategy to life visually.

They've been in Lakeland since 2013. Free workshops. Real presence in the business community.

Custom websites from $500 to $3,500+ all-inclusive. The approach stays the same regardless of budget.

**Hook:** Central Florida's small businesses deserve a marketing team that knows Lakeland — not an agency calling in from across the country

```text
Central Florida's small businesses deserve a marketing team that knows Lakeland — not an agency calling in from across the country.

There's a difference between knowing "small business marketing" and knowing Lakeland small business marketing.

A remote agency doesn't know that the Cohatch community is where local entrepreneurs connect. They don't know Southeastern University's influence on the business landscape. They don't understand what it means to build a reputation in a town where word of mouth still drives half the new business.

Spark Sites was founded in Lakeland in 2018 and hasn't left.

Grant Sparks has been building websites and technology systems for 20 years — the last several focused on helping Central Florida businesses build real digital foundations. Nicole Rhea is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University, applying academic strategy to real local businesses. Amber Beardmore runs creative production and makes everything look the way it should.

The team runs free workshops at Cohatch. Not webinars from a recording studio — in-person events where local business owners sit around a table and talk about what's actually happening in their marketing. People leave with actionable steps, not a pitch.

When Spark Sites builds a website, the local context matters:

Local SEO is built in from the start — not as an afterthought, but as a core part of the structure. Google Business optimization. Content that reflects the Lakeland market. Design that speaks to the community the business actually serves.

Training is included at every tier. Because a website built by someone who understands the local market should be maintained by an owner who understands their own site.

Custom websites start at $500 for a links page. Starter sites at $900. Full multi-page business sites from $1,500–$2,500. The all-inclusive package at $3,500+ bundles website, Google Business, email marketing, and ongoing strategy.

Every tier gets the same local expertise. The same education-first approach. The same team that lives down the road.

Supporting local businesses isn't just what Spark Sites does. It's the only thing they do.

Found a web design team at a Cohatch workshop in Lakeland. They live here, they work here, they actually show up to local events.

Tried two remote agencies for website help. Both times felt like talking to a chatbot. Generic strategies, no understanding of the local market, and zero personal connection.

Then went to a free marketing workshop at Cohatch. Grant and Nicole were running it — explaining SEO, content strategy, social media basics. No sales pitch. Just education.

Turns out they run Spark Sites, a full-service agency based right here in Lakeland. Nicole teaches marketing at Southeastern. Grant has been in web tech since 2004.

They built the new site in weeks. Explained every choice. Included training. And when something needed tweaking, the team was a phone call away — not a support ticket queue.

Custom sites from $500 to $3,500+. Local team. Local expertise.

Here's how even brand-new Lakeland businesses are getting professional websites from a team that understands the local market.

- Local SEO from day one — structured for Google Business, local search, and Lakeland-area traffic
- Content that speaks to the community the business actually serves

They run free workshops at Cohatch in Lakeland. They're active in local business groups. Their reputation is built face-to-face, not through paid ads from across the country.

"I am so grateful for my conversation with Nicole and Grant. I received so much feedback and guidance and a whole lot of value on a FREE call.

I am looking forward to learning more from them as they are both amazing guides in their areas of expertise." — Holtzberg L.

That's the power of working with a team that shows up in person.

Not a Zoom call from a remote office. A real workshop at Cohatch in Lakeland where local business owners sat down, asked questions, and got real answers.

**Hook:** Lakeland businesses using AI-powered marketing are outpacing competitors who still do everything manually. The gap is widening fast

```text
Lakeland businesses using AI-powered marketing are outpacing competitors who still do everything manually. The gap is widening fast.

Here's what's happening right now in small business marketing:

AI-powered content generation is producing more relevant, more frequent content at a fraction of the cost. Automated workflows are handling email sequences, social posting, and lead follow-up without anyone touching a keyboard. SEO strategies powered by AI tools are finding opportunities that manual research would miss entirely.

And most small business owners in Lakeland haven't started yet.

Not because they're behind. Because nobody has shown them how.

That's where Spark Sites comes in — and why the website is just the beginning.

Spark Sites builds custom websites for small businesses starting at $500. But behind every website is a team with deeper strategic expertise that most agencies in this market simply don't have.

Nicole Rhea isn't just a marketing strategist. She's a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. When she builds a content strategy or SEO plan, it's grounded in frameworks that most agencies haven't been exposed to.

Grant doesn't just build websites. He's been in technology for 20 years and has been implementing AI automation for businesses — content bots, workflow automation, AI-powered SEO optimization. When Sarah Mulcahy came in for a strategy session, Grant mapped out AI automations that improved both internal and external workflows in a single consultation.

The website is the digital foundation. But the team behind it can take a business much further:

- AI-powered content generation (Content Bot for consistent SEO content)
- Workflow automation (reducing manual work by hours per week)
- Strategic consulting ($120/hr sessions for businesses ready to implement AI)
- Full marketing services — SEO, ads, social media — all informed by AI tools

Most agencies are still doing everything manually and charging the same prices.

Spark Sites uses AI as a force multiplier — making high-end marketing outcomes accessible at small business pricing.

The all-inclusive package at $3,500+ bundles website, Google Business, email marketing, and ongoing strategy. Individual consulting sessions start at $120/hr for businesses that want targeted AI implementation guidance.

Start with a discovery call. Grant will walk through what AI tools could actually help the business — no jargon, no hype. Just practical technology applied to real problems.

Just saw what AI-powered content and automation did for a local business. The owner saves 15 hours a week and the results improved.

A Lakeland business owner went to Spark Sites for a website. During the discovery call, Grant asked about their marketing workflow. Turns out they were spending hours every week on tasks that AI could handle in minutes.

One strategy session later — AI automations for email follow-ups, content generation for SEO, and a workflow that cut their weekly marketing admin in half.

The website was just the entry point. The real value was the strategic expertise behind it.

Grant has 20 years in technology. Nicole is literally a Professor of Marketing. The consulting runs $120/hr and most businesses get more value from one session than they got from their last three months of agency work.

Websites from $500 to $3,500+. Strategy sessions for businesses ready to bring in AI.

**Hook:** Here's how even non-technical business owners in Lakeland are getting AI-powered websites and marketing — without learning a thing

```text
Here's how even non-technical business owners in Lakeland are getting AI-powered websites and marketing — without learning a thing.

The trick isn't learning AI. It's hiring a team that already knows it.

Spark Sites builds custom websites with AI-powered marketing already wired in:

- Content Bot — AI-generated SEO content, reviewed by humans, published consistently
- Workflow automation — email sequences, lead follow-up, social scheduling
- AI-optimized SEO — finding keyword opportunities manual research misses
- Smart analytics — understanding what's actually driving traffic and leads

The business owner doesn't need to touch any of it. The team handles implementation. But for owners who want to go deeper, strategy sessions at $120/hr give direct access to Grant's 20 years of technology experience and Nicole's academic marketing expertise.

One client described it this way: "Thoughtful guidance on implementing AI automations to improve our internal and external workflows, freeing us up to interact more meaningfully with our clients and our team."

That was from a single consultation.

Websites start at $500. The all-inclusive package at $3,500+ bundles website, Google Business, email, and ongoing AI-powered marketing strategy.

Most agencies haven't caught up to AI yet. This team is already implementing it for Central Florida businesses.

We appreciate the time he spent with us to really understand our business objectives and the thoughtful guidance he gave us on implementing AI automations to improve our internal and external workflows, freeing us up to interact more meaningfully with our clients and our team." — Sarah M.

That's what a single session looks like when the team behind it has real depth.

Grant has been in technology for 20 years. He doesn't just build websites — he sees the systems behind a business and identifies where AI tools can save hours of manual work.

Nicole is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. The strategy isn't surface-level advice — it's grounded in academic marketing frameworks applied to real businesses.

Together, they built Spark Sites to be more than a web design shop. The website is the foundation. But behind it: AI-powered content generation, workflow automation, SEO strategy, and consulting for businesses ready to implement real technology.

Most Lakeland businesses come in for a website. Many discover that the strategic and AI expertise behind it is even more valuable.

Custom websites from $500 to $3,500+ all-inclusive. Strategy sessions at $120/hr for businesses that want focused AI implementation.

Start with a discovery call. Grant will walk through what's possible — practically, no hype.

**Hook:** Most agencies learn marketing from YouTube. This one has a Professor of Marketing from Southeastern University on the strategy team

```text
Most agencies learn marketing from YouTube. This one has a Professor of Marketing from Southeastern University on the strategy team.

There's a difference between knowing marketing and understanding marketing.

Knowing marketing means picking up tactics — a headline formula here, a funnel template there. YouTube tutorials. Blog posts. Trial and error on someone else's dime.

Understanding marketing means grasping the frameworks behind why things work. Buyer psychology. Messaging architecture. Research-backed strategy that doesn't depend on the algorithm of the month.

Nicole Rhea isn't learning marketing. She teaches it. At Southeastern University in Lakeland.

That depth shows up in every Spark Sites project. The strategy conversations aren't "let's try this and see." They're "here's why this approach matches the audience psychology and here's what the research says about its effectiveness."

Grant Sparks complements that academic depth with 20 years of hands-on technology experience. He's built websites, implemented AI automations, optimized SEO, and managed ad campaigns since 2004. The technical execution matches the strategic sophistication.

Amber Beardmore directs creative production — turning strategy into visuals, layouts, and designs that communicate what the business needs to say.

Academic strategy. Technical depth. Creative execution. Under one roof.

What this means for clients:

The website isn't just well-designed. It's strategically structured — page layout, content hierarchy, SEO architecture, and conversion paths all informed by marketing science, not guesswork.

The training isn't just "here's how to log in." It's a genuine transfer of understanding so the business owner makes better marketing decisions going forward.

The discovery call isn't just a sales conversation. It's a strategy session where Grant and Nicole bring their combined expertise to the specific business situation.

Custom websites: $500 links page, $900 starter, $1,500–$2,500 full business site, $3,500+ all-inclusive with Google Business, email marketing, and ongoing strategy.

Strategy sessions: $120/hr for businesses that want focused expertise without a full service commitment.

Free discovery call. Come with questions. Leave with answers and a clear understanding of what the business needs — whether Spark Sites builds it or not.

Asked my web designer about their marketing strategy background. Turns out their strategist teaches marketing at a real university.

Most agencies hire junior marketers who learned from online courses. No judgment — everyone starts somewhere. But when it's a business owner's money on the line, the depth of the strategy matters.

Spark Sites in Lakeland has Nicole Rhea on marketing strategy. She's a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. Not "studied marketing" — teaches it.

Grant handles the technology side — 20 years of building websites, implementing AI tools, and understanding what actually makes a site perform.

The difference showed up immediately. The strategy session felt like a lecture from someone who deeply understands the material. Not a pitch. Not a template. A genuine breakdown of what the business needs and why.

Custom websites from $500 to $3,500+. The same academic-grade strategy at every level.

Here's how Lakeland businesses get enterprise-level strategy from a team with a Marketing Professor and 20 years of web expertise.

Enterprise companies pay six figures for marketing strategy. They hire MBAs, PhDs, and consultants with academic credentials.

"Amazing guides in their areas of expertise" hits different when you know what those areas actually are.

Nicole Rhea is a Professor of Marketing at Southeastern University. The guidance she provides isn't pulled from blog posts — it comes from teaching marketing frameworks to the next generation of professionals. That depth shows up in every strategy conversation.

Grant Sparks has been in web technology for over 20 years. Building, optimizing, implementing AI tools, and understanding what makes a digital presence actually work. Not theory — hands-on expertise refined across two decades.

Together with Amber on creative production, the team delivers something rare: academic-level marketing strategy combined with deep technical execution at small business prices.

The workshops at Cohatch are free. The discovery calls are free. The education starts before any money changes hands.

Custom websites from $500 to $3,500+ all-inclusive. Strategy sessions at $120/hr.
