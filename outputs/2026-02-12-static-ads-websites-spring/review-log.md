# Review Log — Websites for the Spring, Batch 001

## Review Date: 2026-02-12

## Lenses Applied (5 — Copy Review tier)

1. FTC Compliance
2. Meta Policy
3. Copy Quality
4. Voice Authenticity
5. Substantiation

## Summary

| Severity | Count | Action Taken |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| P1 | 3 | User acknowledged — will filter at posting/recording stage |
| P2 | 10 | User acknowledged — will filter at posting/recording stage |
| P3 | 9 | Noted for future iterations |

## User Decision

User elected to keep all ads without compliance corrections. Rationale: ads will be used as both static ad copy AND video script frameworks. User will filter and adapt at the posting/recording stage based on platform requirements.

## Factual Corrections Applied

- **"Since 2018" → "Since 2013"** across all ad copy (Spark Sites founding year was 2013, not 2018)
- **soul.md** updated to reflect correct founding year (2013)

## Credential Verification (Confirmed by User)

| Claim | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Nicole Rhea — Professor of Marketing | ✓ Confirmed | Exact title is correct |
| Southeastern University | ✓ Confirmed | Correct institution |
| Grant — since 2004 | ✓ Confirmed | Professional start date accurate |
| Spark Sites — founding year | ✓ Corrected | 2013, not 2018 |
| Consulting rate — $120/hr | ✓ Confirmed | Current and accurate |

## Key Findings by Lens

### FTC Compliance
- 0 P1, 4 P2, 6 P3
- Primary risk: Ad 4 (AI-Forward) fabricated "15 hours/week" metric
- UGC/Native primaries across all ads present fabricated first-person stories

### Meta Policy
- 0 P1, 10 P2, 4 P3
- Primary risk: Personal Attributes violations in headlines and hooks ("you" + negative state)
- Ad 4 image prompts trigger known visual flags (steep graph, before/after split)
- Ad 3 (Local Trust) was cleanest — no issues found

### Copy Quality
- 0 P1, 17 P2, 14 P3
- Primary risk: Body copy converges across all 5 angles (same credentials/pricing recital)
- "Here's how even..." hook template used 4 times
- Hook lengths exceed 135-char target in multiple locations
- Same 2 testimonials recycled across 5 ads

### Voice Authenticity
- 2 P1, 5 P2, 9 P3
- Ad 4 P4 is condescending ("a losing one") — violates voice.md
- Ad 4 P1 uses pressure tactics ("gap is widening fast") — violates voice.md
- AI structural tells in Ad 4 (parallel sentence construction)
- Ads 1, 2, 3, 5 substantially cleaner

### Substantiation
- 3 P1, 10 P2, 4 P3
- Fabricated "15 hours/week" statistic in Ad 4
- Multiple fabricated UGC narratives without real client basis
- Credential claims verified by user (see above)
- Sarah M. testimonial used without attribution in Ad 4 P3

## Recommendations for Next Batch

1. Source 3-5 additional testimonials to reduce reuse
2. Differentiate body copy across angles (biggest quality improvement available)
3. Rewrite Ad 4 (AI-Forward) with opportunity framing instead of fear/pressure
4. Vary CTA language across ad types
5. Create unique hook structures (avoid template repetition)
