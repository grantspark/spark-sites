## Script 1: AI Forward — Problem-Solution

**Hook:**
Your competitors are already using AI in their marketing. You don't need to learn it. You need a team that already knows it.

**Body:**
Here's what's happening right now. Small businesses in Lakeland are using AI to write content, automate workflows, and compete with companies ten times their size.

They didn't take a course. They didn't hire a developer.

They found a growth partner who already understands the technology.

That's what we do at Spark Sites. We've been building websites since 2004. When AI became a real tool, we built it into everything — content, automation, customer journeys.

You focus on your business. We handle the tech.

**CTA:**
Custom websites starting at five hundred dollars. AI-powered marketing included.

## Script 2: AI Forward — Curiosity

**Hook:**
The reason some Lakeland businesses are growing faster than others right now has nothing to do with their budget.

**Body:**
It's AI. But not the way you think.

They're not using ChatGPT to write blog posts. They've got a team that builds AI into their website, their marketing, their workflows.

Content that writes itself in their voice. Automations that handle the stuff they used to do at midnight. Systems that free them up to actually run the business.

One of our clients told us the AI automations we built freed her up to interact more meaningfully with her clients and team.

That's the difference. AI as a business tool. Not a buzzword.

**CTA:**
Spark Sites. Websites from five hundred. AI built in. Lakeland-based.

## Script 3: Education First — Empathy

**Hook:**
Paying for marketing you can't explain to someone else? That's not a strategy. That's a hostage situation.

**Body:**
I've sat in those meetings. The agency throws around acronyms. CTR. ROAS. Conversion pixel. And you nod along because asking feels embarrassing.

Then the invoice comes and you have no idea what you paid for.

We built Spark Sites to be the opposite. Our marketing strategist is literally a Professor of Marketing. Not because we need to impress you. Because clarity is the skill.

We explain the why before the what. Every metric. Every dollar. Every decision.

The more you understand, the better decisions you make.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred. Education built into every project.

## Script 4: Education First — Testimonial-Led

**Hook:**
"I received so much feedback and guidance and a whole lot of value on a free call." That's from one of our clients.

**Body:**
She found us at a workshop we hosted at Cohatch in Lakeland. We talked about marketing strategy. Not to sell. To teach.

That's how we operate. We lead with value. We run free workshops. Our discovery calls are designed so you learn something, not so we close a deal.

Nicole is a Professor of Marketing. Grant's been building websites for over twenty years. We have the expertise to go deep and the conviction to make it simple.

Your marketing team should make you smarter. Not more confused.

**CTA:**
Spark Sites. Websites from five hundred. We explain everything.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 5: Local Trust — Identity Callout

**Hook:**
If you run a business in Lakeland, Florida — and you've been thinking about getting a real website — this is for you.

**Body:**
We're not a remote agency. We're not a template mill. We're Lakeland people building for Lakeland businesses.

Grant drives past your storefront on the way to the grocery store. Nicole teaches at Southeastern University. We know the community because we live in it.

That matters more than you think. When your marketing partner understands your neighborhood, they understand your customer.

We've been doing this since 2013. Our clients stay because we explain what we're doing, we stick around after launch, and we treat their business like it matters.

Because it does.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred dollars. Lakeland's growth partner.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 6: Local Trust — Social Proof

**Hook:**
There are ten thousand web design companies online. Here's why Lakeland business owners keep choosing the one down the road.

**Body:**
You can find someone on Fiverr for two hundred dollars. You can use a free template. You can hire an agency in another timezone.

Or you can work with someone who knows what it means to run a business on South Florida Avenue.

"Spark Sites are the best organization to work with. Intelligent, productive, and a pleasure to work with in every possible way." That's from Charles.

"Cost efficient and streamlined." That's Wesley.

We're accountable because our reputation is in this community. Right next to yours.

**CTA:**
Spark Sites. Custom websites from five hundred. Based in Lakeland.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 7: Burned by Agencies — Empathy

**Hook:**
Every entrepreneur has a marketing horror story. The agency that disappeared. The freelancer who ghosted. The invoice that made no sense.

**Body:**
That skepticism you're carrying? It's healthy. The right marketing partner won't fight it. They'll welcome it.

At Spark Sites, we assume every new client has been burned before. Because most have.

So here's how we work differently. We explain everything. We don't disappear after the invoice. We teach alongside every project. And we price for small business budgets. Not enterprise ones.

Grant's been building websites since 2004. Nicole's a Professor of Marketing. We're in Lakeland. We answer the phone.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred. Transparent. Education-first. Built to rebuild your trust.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 8: Burned by Agencies — Contrarian

**Hook:**
Hot take. Most agencies make more money when you don't understand what they're doing.

**Body:**
Think about it. If you understood your SEO, you'd know if they were actually working. If you understood your ad metrics, you'd know if they were spending wisely.

Confusion is profitable for them. Clarity is dangerous.

We built Spark Sites on the opposite model. We want you to understand everything. Because informed clients make better decisions. And better decisions make us look good.

Our marketing strategist teaches marketing at the university level. She doesn't simplify because she can't go deep. She simplifies because that IS the skill.

**CTA:**
Websites from five hundred. Full transparency. A team that wants you to understand.

## Script 9: DIY Trap — Problem Agitation

**Hook:**
Be honest. How many hours have you spent fighting your website?

**Body:**
Dragging blocks that won't align. Watching tutorials on why your header looks wrong. Googling "why won't my site show up on Google" at eleven pm.

You started with Wix or Squarespace because it seemed smart. Free. Easy. Total control.

But after twenty, thirty, forty hours — it still looks like a template. Because it is a template.

Meanwhile your business is growing. Your work is premium. And your website is the first thing people see.

There's a point where DIY stops being frugal and starts being expensive.

**CTA:**
Custom websites starting at five hundred. Not templates. Custom. Built by a team that's been doing this since 2004.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 10: DIY Trap — Reframe

**Hook:**
Wix is free. Squarespace is sixteen bucks a month. Your time is worth more than both.

**Body:**
Here's the math nobody does.

Forty hours building a DIY website at even thirty dollars an hour? That's twelve hundred dollars of your time. For a site that still looks like a template and doesn't rank on Google.

A custom website from Spark Sites starts at five hundred. SEO built in. Mobile responsive. Training included so you can update it yourself.

You're not saving money by doing it yourself. You're just hiding the cost.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred. Stop trading your time for a site that doesn't reflect your work.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 11: DIY Trap — Transformation

**Hook:**
Imagine sending a potential client your website and feeling proud instead of apologizing.

**Body:**
"Oh, I'm redoing my website." "It's not great but we're working on it." "Just check our Instagram instead."

Sound familiar? That's the DIY gap. Your business has grown past your website and everyone can see it except you.

A custom website changes that conversation. It matches the quality of your work. It ranks on Google. It makes the impression you've been wanting.

And it starts at five hundred dollars. Not five thousand.

**CTA:**
Spark Sites. Custom websites for small businesses. Lakeland-based. Education included.

sparkmysite.com.

---

## Script 12: Education First — Contrarian

**Hook:**
Unpopular opinion. Your marketing agency should be trying to make you smarter. Most are doing the opposite.

**Body:**
Why would an agency teach you how to read your own analytics? If you understood them, you might realize you don't need to pay them as much.

That's the dirty secret of the industry. Complexity is profitable.

At Spark Sites, we flip that. Nicole is a Professor of Marketing. Teaching is literally her job. Grant's been building the tech for twenty years. He'll show you what's under the hood.

We explain everything because we believe informed clients make better partners. Not because we're generous. Because it works.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred. Every metric explained. Every dollar accounted for.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 13: Local Trust — Transformation

**Hook:**
From "I need a website" to "my website is my best salesperson." That's what happens when your growth partner is in your community.

**Body:**
Remote agencies build websites. Local teams build relationships.

We sit down with you. We understand your actual business — not your industry category. We know Lakeland. We know the customers walking through your door.

Then we build something that speaks to them. Not a generic template. A custom website that sounds like you and ranks where your customers are searching.

Since 2013 that's been the Spark Sites approach. A growth partner, not a vendor.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred. Lakeland team. Real partnership.

sparkmysite.com.

## Script 14: Burned by Agencies — Identity Callout

**Hook:**
If you're a small business owner who's been burned by marketing agencies — and you're not sure you can trust another one — this is for you.

**Body:**
You're not wrong to be skeptical. That last experience was real. The money was real. The disappointment was real.

Here's what we do differently. We explain everything before you pay. We show you what we're building and why. We train you to manage it yourself so you're never dependent.

We've been in Lakeland since 2013. Same team. Same phone number. Same commitment to transparency.

"We appreciate the time he spent with us to really understand our business objectives." That's Sarah. She didn't have to wonder what she was getting.

**CTA:**
Spark Sites. Websites from five hundred. Built to rebuild your trust.

sparkmysite.com.

---

## Script 15: AI Forward — Identity Callout

**Hook:**
If you're an entrepreneur who knows AI matters but doesn't know where to start — you're in the right place.

**Body:**
You don't need to understand machine learning. You don't need to take a course. You need a team that already builds AI into websites and marketing systems.

Content that writes in your voice. Automations that handle the midnight tasks. A website that works harder than a template ever could.

Grant's been building web technology since 2004. Nicole's a Professor of Marketing. Together they bring technical depth and marketing expertise to every project.

You handle the vision. We handle the tech.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred. AI-powered marketing. Lakeland-based.

sparkmysite.com.

---

## Script 16: DIY Trap — Identity Callout

**Hook:**
If you're a founder who built your own website because you thought it would save money — and now you realize it's costing you something more valuable than cash — listen up.

**Body:**
Your time. That's what it's costing you.

Every Saturday spent tweaking fonts. Every evening Googling how to make your contact form work. Every moment wondering why your site doesn't show up on Google.

That time could be going toward clients. Toward growth. Toward the work you actually started this business to do.

Custom websites from Spark Sites start at five hundred dollars. We handle everything. SEO included. Training included. You get your weekends back.

**CTA:**
sparkmysite.com. Let someone who's been doing this for twenty years handle the website.

## Script 17: Burned by Agencies — Testimonial-Led

**Hook:**
"Intelligent, productive, and a pleasure to work with in every possible way." That's Charles.

**Body:**
What Charles didn't mention is that we spent over an hour understanding his business before we talked about deliverables.

That's the Spark Sites approach. We don't start with a quote. We start with understanding.

Most agencies rush to the proposal. We rush to comprehension. What does your business actually need? What does success look like for you specifically?

Grant and Nicole bring twenty-plus years of combined expertise. But expertise without listening is just noise.

**CTA:**
Custom websites from five hundred. We listen first. Build second.

sparkmysite.com.

---

## Script 18: Education First — Transformation

**Hook:**
What happens when your marketing team actually teaches you what they're doing? You make better decisions. Every single time.

**Body:**
Most entrepreneurs sign off on marketing they don't fully understand. Not because they're lazy. Because nobody took the time to explain it.

We explain it. Every metric. Every strategy. Every dollar.

After working with us, you don't just have a better website. You understand what makes it better. You know what SEO actually means for your business. You can look at your analytics and know what you're seeing.

That's the education-first model. It makes you a better business owner. And it makes everything we build for you more effective.

**CTA:**
Spark Sites. Websites from five hundred. Education included.
