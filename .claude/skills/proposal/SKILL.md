name: proposal
description: "Generate client proposals from explicit requests and implicit needs. Reads pricing matrix, offer files, and product ladder to produce line-itemized proposals with upsell recommendations. Use when: user says proposal, quote, estimate, scope, or describes a client request. Supports intake from conversation notes, call transcripts, or direct description."
---

# Proposal Generator

Turn client requests into structured proposals — what they asked for, what they actually need, and how to phase it.

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Never invent pricing.** Every line item must trace to `reference/domain/pricing-matrix.md` or an `offers/[service]/offer.md` file. If a service isn't in the matrix, flag it and ask.
2. **Never skip the explicit request.** The proposal always leads with exactly what the client asked for, quoted at the prices in the matrix.
3. **Upsells are recommendations, not surprises.** The "Recommended" section explains WHY each addition matters — connected to the client's situation, not generic.
4. **Never fabricate labor hours.** Use the estimates in the pricing matrix. If a task isn't listed, estimate conservatively and mark it as "estimated."
5. **Proposals are client-facing documents.** Write in Spark's voice (warm, clear, educational). No internal jargon, no margin notes in the output.

---

## Step 0: Find Business Repo

**CWD-first:** If `reference/core/` exists in CWD, you're in the business repo — use it.

If CWD is NOT a business repo:
- Check `.claude/settings.local.json` for additionalDirectories that contain `reference/core/`
- Or ask the user for the path

---

## Step 1: Load Pricing Context

Read these files (all required):

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Pricing Matrix | `reference/domain/pricing-matrix.md` | Internal costs, labor hours, upsell triggers |
| Product Ladder | `reference/domain/product-ladder.md` | How services connect, upsell paths |
| Soul | `reference/core/soul.md` | Voice and values for proposal tone |
| Voice | `reference/core/voice.md` | How Spark communicates |

Also load the specific offer file(s) for whatever services the client is asking about:

```
reference/offers/[service]/offer.md
```

If the client mentions multiple services, load all relevant offer files.

---

## Step 2: Gather Client Context

Ask the user for the intake. Accept any of these formats:

| Input Type | Example | How to Handle |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Direct description** | "S&D Real Estate wants an MLS install" | Parse explicit requests, note industry signals |
| **Call notes / transcript** | Pasted text from a call | Extract explicit asks AND implicit signals |
| **Email / message** | Forwarded client communication | Same — explicit + implicit |
| **Bullet list** | "Website, SEO, maybe social" | Treat as explicit, probe for details |

### What to Extract

**Explicit requests** — What the client directly asked for:
- Specific services mentioned
- Specific features mentioned (e.g., "MLS install", "e-commerce", "blog")
- Budget mentioned (if any)
- Timeline mentioned (if any)

**Implicit needs** — What the context reveals they also need:
- Use the "Implicit Need Signals" table in the pricing matrix
- Use the "Cross-Sell / Upsell Quick Reference" table
- Industry-specific signals (real estate = MLS + local SEO + Google Ads; restaurant = Google Business + social + influencer events; etc.)
- Things they mentioned in passing but didn't ask for ("nobody can find us" = SEO)

**Client details:**
- Business name
- Industry / business type
- Location (if relevant for local services)
- Existing website (if any)
- Current marketing (if mentioned)

### If Details Are Thin

If the user gives a one-liner like "S&D wants an MLS install," work with what you have. Cross-reference against the pricing matrix and product ladder to build recommendations. Don't interrogate — generate the best proposal you can from available info, and flag assumptions.

---

## Step 3: Build the Proposal

### Structure

Every proposal follows this format:

```markdown
---
type: output
subtype: proposal
date: YYYY-MM-DD
client: [Business Name]
status: draft
---

# Proposal: [Client Name]

**Prepared by:** Spark
**Date:** [Date]
**Valid for:** 30 days

---

## Understanding

[2-4 sentences summarizing what the client needs and why. Demonstrates
we listened. References their situation, not generic marketing speak.]

---

## Scope: What You Asked For

[Line items for exactly what the client explicitly requested.
Each item includes description, what's included, and price.]

| Service | Description | Price |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [service] | [what's included, briefly] | $X |
| [service] | [what's included, briefly] | $X |

**Subtotal:** $X

---

## Recommended: What Will Make This Work

[Upsell section. Each recommendation tied to the client's specific
situation with a one-sentence "why this matters for you" rationale.]

| Service | Why It Matters | Price |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| [service] | [specific rationale tied to THEIR business] | $X |
| [service] | [specific rationale tied to THEIR business] | $X |

**Subtotal (if all recommended):** $X

---

## Investment Summary

| | Services | Price |
|---|---------|-------|
| **What you asked for** | [list] | $X |
| **Recommended additions** | [list] | $X |
| **Total (with recommendations)** | | $X |

*Recommended additions are optional. We'll deliver what you asked for
regardless — these are our professional recommendations based on your goals.*

---

## Phasing (if applicable)

[Only include if the total scope is large enough to warrant phases.
Helps clients who can't do everything at once.]

### Phase 1: [Name] — [Timeline]
- [deliverables]
- Investment: $X

### Phase 2: [Name] — [Timeline]
- [deliverables]
- Investment: $X

---

## What's Next

1. Review this proposal
2. Let us know which services you'd like to move forward with
3. We'll send an invoice for the first phase
4. Kick-off call to align on details and timeline

---

## About Spark

[Brief — pull from soul.md. 2-3 sentences max. Not a sales pitch,
just a reminder of who we are.]
```

### Phasing Rules

- **Under $2,000 total:** No phasing needed unless client signals budget constraints
- **$2,000–$5,000:** Suggest 2 phases (core deliverable first, then additions)
- **Over $5,000:** Always phase. Lead with the most impactful deliverable.
- **Phase 1 always includes the explicit request.** Never push what they asked for to Phase 2.

### Pricing Rules

- Use exact prices from the pricing matrix and offer files
- For ranges (e.g., "$1,500–$2,500"), pick the midpoint or ask user to specify
- For custom pricing (influencer events), note "Custom — quoted after scoping"
- For add-ons not in the matrix, estimate and mark: "(estimated — confirm before sending)"
- **Recurring vs. one-time:** Clearly separate. Monthly costs get their own line with "/mo" suffix
- **Third-party costs:** Note but don't include in totals (e.g., "Ad spend is additional, billed directly by Google/Meta")

---

## Step 4: Internal Notes (Not Client-Facing)

After the proposal, generate an internal-only section for the team:

```markdown
---

## Internal Notes (DO NOT SEND TO CLIENT)

### Labor Estimate

**Important:** Use the pricing matrix as the source of truth. Some services are flat-rate (the client price IS the line item — do not back-calculate an hourly rate). Others are hourly. Match whatever the matrix says.

| Service | Est. Hours | Rate | Internal Cost |
|---------|-----------|------|---------------|
| [flat-rate service] | [hours from matrix] | Flat rate | $[matrix price] |
| [hourly service] | X hrs | $XX/hr | $X |

**Total quoted:** $X

### Upsell Strategy
- [What to emphasize in the follow-up call]
- [Which recommended service has the highest close probability]
- [What to listen for that would trigger additional recommendations]

### Assumptions
- [Any assumptions made due to incomplete info]
- [Anything flagged as "estimated" in the proposal]
```

---

## Step 5: Email Draft (Ember Voice)

Every proposal includes a ready-to-send email written in the **Ember** persona.

**Ember** is Spark's client-facing support voice — energetic, warm, people-first friendly. Think: the person at the front desk who genuinely lights up when someone walks in. Not salesy, not formal, just glad to help.

> **TODO:** Full Ember persona definition coming (will live in `reference/brand/ember.md`). Until then, use these guidelines.

### Ember Voice Rules

- **Open with energy.** Warm, specific greeting — not "Dear Client" or "Hope this finds you well." Something like "Hey [Name]!" or "Hi [Name]! Great chatting with you about [thing]."
- **Get to the estimate fast.** One sentence of context, then the number. Don't bury the lead.
- **Close with the link + question pattern.** Always this exact structure:

```
Here's how to get started: [LINK]

Or, did you have any questions before we get started?
```

- **Sign off warm.** Short, human. "Talk soon!" or "Excited to get this going!" — not "Best regards."
- **Keep it short.** The proposal has all the details. The email is the friendly nudge to open it.

### Email Template

```
Subject: Your [project type] estimate is ready!

Hey [Name]!

[One warm sentence referencing the conversation or their business — show you were listening.]

Here's a quick look at what we put together:

[Brief scope summary — 2-3 bullet points max, with total]

Here's how to get started: [LINK]

Or, did you have any questions before we get started?

[Warm sign-off],
Spark Team
```

### Save Location

Save the email draft as: `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD-proposal-{client-slug}/email.md`

---

## Step 6: Save and Present

1. Save to: `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD-proposal-{client-slug}/proposal.md`
2. Save internal notes: `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD-proposal-{client-slug}/internal-notes.md`
3. Save email draft: `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD-proposal-{client-slug}/email.md`
4. Present a summary to the user (not the whole proposal — they can read the files):
   - What was quoted (explicit)
   - What was recommended (upsell)
   - Total range
   - Any flags or assumptions
5. Ask: "Want me to adjust anything before you send this?"

---

## Offer Context Resolution

When the client requests multiple services, load ALL relevant offer files. This is not single-offer mode — proposals often span the entire product ladder.

```
Client asks for "website and SEO"
→ Load: offers/websites/offer.md + offers/seo/offer.md + pricing-matrix.md
```

For services that cross-sell naturally (per the product ladder), proactively load adjacent offer files to inform the Recommended section.

---

## Examples

### Example: S&D Real Estate — MLS Install

**Explicit:** MLS/IDX installation on existing website
**Implicit signals:** Real estate → local SEO, Google Ads (homebuyer keywords), site navigation updates, Google Business optimization

**Scope (What They Asked For):**
- MLS/IDX Installation: $450
- Site edits (navigation, listing pages): included in MLS install

**Recommended:**
- Local SEO one-time optimization: $900 (people need to find those listings)
- Google Business Profile setup: $150 (real estate is hyper-local)
- Google Ads setup + management: $350 setup + $350/mo (capture "homes for sale in [city]" searches)

**Phasing:** Phase 1 = MLS + site edits ($450). Phase 2 = SEO + Google ($1,400 + $350/mo).

---

## Step 7: Push to ClickUp

After files are saved and the user approves the proposal, push the proposal data to the associated ClickUp task.

### Find the Task

1. Ask the user for the client name or task reference (they may already know the task ID or custom ID)
2. If not provided, search ClickUp using the client name, project keywords, and any identifying details (e.g., "S&D", "Georgia", "MLS") — run 2-3 searches with different terms to increase match confidence
3. Present the best match to the user and confirm before updating

### Update the Task

Once confirmed, push all three documents:

**Description (append):** Append to the existing task description with a `---` separator, in this order:
1. **Internal notes** (`internal-notes.md`) — first, so team context is at the top
2. **Proposal** (`proposal.md`) — second, the client-facing document

Strip the YAML frontmatter from both files before appending. Keep the markdown content as-is.

**Comment:** Post the email draft as a task comment in this format:
```
DRAFT-ONLY: [full contents of email.md]
```

### If ClickUp Is Not Connected

If the MCP ClickUp tools are not available (user hasn't connected ClickUp), skip this step and tell the user: "Proposal saved locally. Connect ClickUp (`/mcp`) to auto-push proposals to tasks."

---

## Recovery from Compaction

If context compresses mid-task:

1. Check `outputs/` for in-progress proposals: `ls -ltd outputs/*-proposal-*/ 2>/dev/null | head -3`
2. Re-read the pricing matrix and product ladder
3. Ask user: "I see a draft proposal for [client]. Continue from here?"

---

## When NOT to Use

- Internal pricing discussions (just read the pricing matrix directly)
- Existing client scope changes (update the existing proposal, don't start fresh)
- Quick verbal quotes (just reference the pricing matrix — no formal proposal needed)

Use `/proposal` when generating a structured, sendable document for a prospective or existing client.
