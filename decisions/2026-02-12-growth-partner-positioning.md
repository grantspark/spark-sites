# Decision: "Growth Partner" as Spark's Central Positioning

## Context

The brand evolution decision (2026-02-12) established that "Spark" becomes the parent brand and "Spark Sites" becomes a sub-brand for the website service. The open question: what does Spark (the parent) actually represent when it's no longer defined by the website deliverable?

We needed a term that captures the full scope — strategy, education, execution, ongoing relationship — without sounding generic ("full-service marketing") or corporate ("strategic consultancy").

## Options

| Term | Signal | Why not |
|------|--------|---------|
| Growth marketing | Tactics that drive revenue | Too generic, everyone claims this |
| Strategic marketing | Strategy-led, not deliverable-led | Sounds corporate, doesn't match voice |
| Marketing partnership | Ongoing relationship | Vague, no direction implied |
| Guided growth | Education + execution | Not industry language |
| Full-service marketing | We do everything | Bland, no differentiation |
| **Growth partner** | Strategy + execution + education + relationship | **Selected** |

## Decision

**We chose: Growth partner.**

"Growth partner" maps directly to soul.md — "guides who walk alongside, not vendors who disappear after the invoice." It signals:

- **Relationship over transaction** — partners, not vendors
- **Strategy before execution** — partners strategize together, vendors take orders
- **Education is inherent** — you can't partner without understanding
- **Websites are one tool** — growth is the goal, the website is a means
- **Ongoing** — partners stay, vendors leave

**The frame:** Spark Sites builds websites. Spark is your growth partner.

## What Changes

- `core/offer.md` — Update brand-level thesis from "growth marketing agency with websites at the core" to growth partner framing. The model description shifts from "websites are the wedge" to "partnership is the model, websites are one entry point."
- `soul.md` — Evolution section gets "growth partner" as the present-day identity.
- `CLAUDE.md` — Headline updates from "Growth marketing agency with websites at the core" to reflect growth partner positioning.
- `voice.md` — Add "growth partner" to approved vocabulary. Avoid "vendor," "provider," "agency" when describing relationship with clients.

## Review Date

Revisit when the parent brand name is decided — ensure "growth partner" still fits the chosen name.
