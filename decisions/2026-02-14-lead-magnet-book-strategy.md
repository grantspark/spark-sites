# Lead Magnet Book Strategy — Premium Hardbound Authority Book

## Situation

Spark is pivoting from website design/support toward consultancy and best practices. Need a premium lead magnet that:
- Serves as a downsell for prospects who can't afford services
- Positions Grant + Nicole as the go-to consultants in SMB marketing
- Builds personal brand around consultancy
- Is a physical, hardbound book ($20-30) -- not an ebook, not a PDF
- Contains Spark's actual agency solutions
- Feels premium enough to charge $27 and have it feel like a steal

## Research

### no-bs-masterplan-chatgpt (existing manuscript)
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Source:** ChatGPT project import
- 119 chapters across 4 parts (Setup, Starting, Sales, AI)
- Encyclopedic -- covers everything from "buy a domain" to "voice-activated funnels"
- Quick Start Guide derivative (7-day brand launch) already carved out
- Strong raw material but needs to be distilled, not published as-is
See: `research/2026-02-14-no-bs-masterplan-chatgpt.md`

## Decision: Premium Hardbound Book (Hormozi Model)

**Not a lead magnet in the traditional sense.** A real book that IS the authority -- physical, hardbound, something that sits on their desk. Spark's methodology in their hands.

### Positioning

"We work with companies of [X, Y, Z profile]. But if that's not you -- or if you want our best practices first -- get this book."

The book is the downsell. The consultation call is the upsell. Done-for-you services come after.

### Funnel

```
Book ($27 hardcover)
  → Consultation call or group coaching call
    → Done-for-you services
```

Also: Free + shipping campaigns periodically for lead gen bursts.
Also: Bulk copies handed to every prospect who can't afford services.

### What the Book Is NOT

- Not 119 chapters of everything (the current manuscript)
- Not a generic marketing textbook
- Not an ebook or PDF
- Not a quiz or assessment

### What the Book IS

- 12-15 chapters of what actually works, based on 857+ real clients
- Structured around a proprietary framework (NAME TBD)
- Matches Spark's experience with their audience's felt pain
- Predicts the future: how SMBs need to adjust NOW for a post-AI world
- Contains real case studies, real numbers, real systems
- Written at a 9th grade reading level, workbook format

## Proposed Structure

### Part 1: The Problem (3-4 chapters)
1. **The Confidence Crisis** — They're spending more and trusting less. 18% confidence stat. You see this every day.
2. **Why Most Marketing Advice Doesn't Work for SMBs** — Built for big budgets, big teams. Not for the owner wearing every hat.
3. **What AI Changed (and What It Didn't)** — The trust paradox. Template sites are dead. Generic content is dead. But human connection, proof, and systems still win.
4. **What We've Seen Across 857 Clients** — Spark's credibility chapter. The patterns that repeat. The mistakes everyone makes.

### Part 2: The Framework (5-7 chapters)
- Each chapter = one component of Spark's proprietary method
- **NAME TBD** — needs to be memorable, ownable, drawable on a napkin
- Should map Spark's 857-client experience onto the demand data
- Must include the Own/Rent/Automate framework for marketing stack
- Should cover the 5-7 things every SMB must build for 2026-2028:
  1. Conversion-optimized website built for AI discovery
  2. First-party data system (email, CRM, customer relationships)
  3. Authentic content engine (human-led, AI-assisted)
  4. Proof system (testimonials, case studies, documented results)
  5. Community or direct audience channel
  6. AI-powered operations layer
  7. Strategic advisor relationship (not tactical vendor)

### Part 3: Implementation (3-4 chapters)
- **First 30 Days** — Refined version of Quick Start Guide
- **Common Mistakes** — From real Spark client experience
- **Case Studies** — 2-3 real Spark clients, before/after with real numbers
- **What's Next** — Clear but non-aggressive CTA. "If you want to do this yourself, you now have everything. If you want help, here's how to start a conversation."

### Appendices
- Self-assessment / marketing scorecard
- Worksheets / templates
- Recommended tools (the 2-3 that matter, not a list of 20)

## CONFIRMED: The Framework Hierarchy (2026-02-14)

Five-tier pyramid. Build from the bottom up. Most SMBs skip to the top and wonder why it doesn't work. Each tier has a "what AI changed" element.

**Framework name: TBD** (acronym possible -- 5 tiers, 5 letters in SPARK)

```
         5. AMPLIFY
        (Paid ads, 27 impressions)
       ─────────────────────
         4. OUTREACH
        (DMs, events, groups)
       ─────────────────────
         3. CONTENT
        (Daily, 10x, value-first)
       ─────────────────────
         2. IDENTITY
        (You ARE the brand, messaging, website)
       ─────────────────────
         1. MINDSET
        (Marketing is your #1 job)
```

### Tier Details

| Tier | Felt Pain (from research) | Spark's Solution | AI Layer |
|------|--------------------------|------------------|----------|
| 1. Mindset | "I'm doing everything myself and drowning" (50% have zero marketing staff) | Accept that YOU are the marketing department | AI makes your messaging CLEARER -- not just faster. AI as a thinking partner for articulating what you actually do. |
| 2. Identity | "I don't know what makes us different" / website as negative selection | Personal brand + messaging + website that doesn't repel | AI commoditized templates -- your HUMAN identity matters more, not less |
| 3. Content | "Content creation is overwhelming" (34% cite this) | Daily content system that doesn't burn you out | AI assists but human-led content wins (creator-led outperforms by 5x) |
| 4. Outreach | "I need more customers consistently" (60% say #1 challenge) | DMs + events + groups = systematic prospecting | AI can scale outreach but authentic relationships still close deals |
| 5. Amplify | "I'm spending money and can't tell if it's working" (18% confidence) | Strategic awareness ads with 27-impression framework | AI-driven campaigns deliver 22% higher ROI -- but only if foundation is right |

### What Grant Has Seen Work (857 Clients) — Mapped to Tiers

1. **Mindset**: Accepting that marketing is the top priority of their role
2. **Identity**: Realizing they (and their team) ARE the brand. Stand-out messaging. Website as trust signal (people won't NOT do business because of it).
3. **Content**: Regular daily content. 10x content output. Providing value in groups without selling.
4. **Outreach**: Direct DMs. Attending niche expos, meetups, live events that target clients attend.
5. **Amplify**: Ongoing awareness ad campaign on Meta and Google (27 impressions before CTA action).

### Models to Reference (Decided Per-Tier as We Build)

Grant loves these models. Each will be evaluated tier-by-tier -- some referenced overtly with citation, some adapted into Spark's own language:
- Mike Michalowicz's "Fix This Next" (hierarchy model -- structural inspiration)
- Hormozi's quadrants from $100M Leads (Warm/Cold x One-to-One/One-to-Many)
- "Brand Hijack" (guerrilla branding)
- "Purple Cow" by Seth Godin (message, voice, identity)
- The Awareness Ladder (Unaware → Problem-Aware → Solution-Aware → etc.)
- DISC temperament profiles (quadrant: Task/People x Extroverted/Introverted) and how it applies to sales pages and calls

### Approach to Models
- Step by step as we develop each tier
- Discover which models fit where as we go
- Decide per model: reference overtly with citation OR adapt into Spark's own framework
- Some (Hormozi) too well-known to rebrand -- reference openly
- Others may become Spark's proprietary language

## Open Questions (Remaining)

1. **Framework name** — Acronym? SPARK mapping? Something else?
2. **Final book title** — "The No Bullshit Marketing Masterplan" is strong but may limit retail distribution
3. **Which real client stories become case studies?** — Need 2-3 compelling before/after
4. **How does the Quick Start Guide relate?** — "First 30 Days" chapter, separate free lead magnet, or both?
5. **Timeline and writing process?** — Estimated 5-8 months

## What Changes

Reference files to be updated as framework develops:
- `reference/core/offer.md` — Add book as product in value ladder
- `reference/domain/product-ladder.md` — Map book into consultancy funnel
- New file: `reference/domain/book-framework.md` — The proprietary framework (once named + built out)

## Next Steps

1. ~~Grant identifies what works across 857 clients~~ ✅ DONE
2. ~~Map patterns onto demand research~~ ✅ DONE
3. ~~Confirm framework hierarchy~~ ✅ DONE
4. Build out each tier (step by step, discovering model references as we go)
5. Name the framework
6. Finalize chapter outline
7. Decide on title
8. Begin writing
