# Brand Name Evolution

## Situation

AI is commoditizing website builds — the service our name is built on. But revenue already tells a different story: retainers are our biggest stream, website builds our smallest. The business has outgrown the name. Soul.md describes "democratizing high-end digital solutions" and "education as a differentiator" — neither of those are captured by "Sites."

The question: does the name need to change, and if so, how?

## Research

### AI Disruption of Web Design
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Source:** Claude Code analysis of Matt Shumer's "Something Big Is Happening" essay
Building websites is becoming a zero-skill activity. The strongest protections Spark Sites has — education, local expertise, ongoing partnerships — aren't captured by the word "sites."
See: `research/2026-02-11-ai-disruption-web-design-claude-code.md`

## Options

### Option A: Evolve "Spark Sites" in place

Redefine what "Sites" means. Keep the name, update the positioning. "Spark Sites builds growth systems for local businesses — starting with your website."

**Pros:**
- Zero cost — no legal, no new domains, no reprinting
- Existing SEO equity for "Lakeland web design" stays intact
- Clients already know the name
- Easiest to execute immediately

**Cons:**
- You'll always be explaining what you actually do
- New prospects will assume you just build websites
- "Sites" anchors the brand to a deliverable that AI is commoditizing
- Harder to lead with education or strategy when the name says otherwise

**Effort:** Low

### Option B: Rebrand to "Spark Growth" (or similar)

New name that captures the full-service growth marketing + education identity. "Spark" stays (brand equity, domain family), but the second word shifts to match reality.

**Pros:**
- Name matches what the business actually does and where it's going
- Opens positioning for education, strategy, AI consulting
- Clean break from the commoditizing "web design" category
- "Growth" is what clients actually want — not a website

**Cons:**
- Legal costs (LLC amendment, new DBA, or new entity)
- Domain changes, email migration, signage, collateral updates
- SEO disruption — existing rankings for "Spark Sites" need redirecting
- Clients may be confused short-term

**Effort:** High

### Option C: "Spark" as parent brand, "Spark Sites" as one service

"Spark" becomes the umbrella. "Spark Sites" is the website offer. Other services get their own names under the Spark family (Spark Ads, Spark SEO, etc. — or just "Spark" for the agency itself).

**Pros:**
- Preserves existing brand equity
- Multi-offer architecture already maps to this
- Each service can be marketed independently
- "Spark Sites" still works for the website entry point
- Parent brand can lead with strategy and education

**Cons:**
- More complex brand architecture to manage
- May confuse local clients who think simply ("I just need a website person")
- Marketing materials need to serve multiple brands
- Need to decide what "Spark" alone means

**Effort:** Medium

### Option D: Keep "Spark Sites," do nothing

The business is working. Retainers are growing. The name hasn't held you back yet. Revisit in 6-12 months when the AI disruption plays out more.

**Pros:**
- Zero distraction from revenue-generating work
- The market may shift in ways you can't predict yet
- Name recognition in Lakeland is an asset right now

**Cons:**
- The window to reposition before competitors do is closing
- Every month of inaction is a month where prospects bucket you as "web design"
- Research says the runway is 1-2 years, not 5

**Effort:** None

## Open Questions

1. What does Nicole think about the brand direction?
2. What's the actual cost of a rebrand (legal, domain, signage)?
3. How much SEO traffic comes from "Spark Sites" specifically vs. service keywords?
4. Are competitors in Lakeland repositioning yet?
5. Could we test a positioning shift before committing to a name change?
