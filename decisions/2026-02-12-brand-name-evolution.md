# Brand Name Evolution

## Situation

AI is commoditizing website builds — the service our name is built on. But revenue already tells a different story: retainers are our biggest stream, website builds our smallest. The business has outgrown the name. Soul.md describes "democratizing high-end digital solutions" and "education as a differentiator" — neither of those are captured by "Sites."

The question: does the name need to change, and if so, how?

## Research

### AI Disruption of Web Design
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Source:** Claude Code analysis of Matt Shumer's "Something Big Is Happening" essay
Building websites is becoming a zero-skill activity. The strongest protections Spark Sites has — education, local expertise, ongoing partnerships — aren't captured by the word "sites."
See: `research/2026-02-11-ai-disruption-web-design-claude-code.md`

## Options

### Option A: Evolve "Spark Sites" in place

Redefine what "Sites" means. Keep the name, update the positioning. "Spark Sites builds growth systems for local businesses — starting with your website."

**Pros:**
- Zero cost — no legal, no new domains, no reprinting
- Existing SEO equity for "Lakeland web design" stays intact
- Clients already know the name
- Easiest to execute immediately

**Cons:**
- You'll always be explaining what you actually do
- New prospects will assume you just build websites
- "Sites" anchors the brand to a deliverable that AI is commoditizing
- Harder to lead with education or strategy when the name says otherwise

**Effort:** Low

### Option B: Rebrand to "Spark Growth" (or similar)

New name that captures the full-service growth marketing + education identity. "Spark" stays (brand equity, domain family), but the second word shifts to match reality.

**Pros:**
- Name matches what the business actually does and where it's going
- Opens positioning for education, strategy, AI consulting
- Clean break from the commoditizing "web design" category
- "Growth" is what clients actually want — not a website

**Cons:**
- Legal costs (LLC amendment, new DBA, or new entity)
- Domain changes, email migration, signage, collateral updates
- SEO disruption — existing rankings for "Spark Sites" need redirecting
- Clients may be confused short-term

**Effort:** High

### Option C: "Spark" as parent brand, "Spark Sites" as one service

"Spark" becomes the umbrella. "Spark Sites" is the website offer. Other services get their own names under the Spark family (Spark Ads, Spark SEO, etc. — or just "Spark" for the agency itself).

**Pros:**
- Preserves existing brand equity
- Multi-offer architecture already maps to this
- Each service can be marketed independently
- "Spark Sites" still works for the website entry point
- Parent brand can lead with strategy and education

**Cons:**
- More complex brand architecture to manage
- May confuse local clients who think simply ("I just need a website person")
- Marketing materials need to serve multiple brands
- Need to decide what "Spark" alone means

**Effort:** Medium

### Option D: Keep "Spark Sites," do nothing

The business is working. Retainers are growing. The name hasn't held you back yet. Revisit in 6-12 months when the AI disruption plays out more.

**Pros:**
- Zero distraction from revenue-generating work
- The market may shift in ways you can't predict yet
- Name recognition in Lakeland is an asset right now

**Cons:**
- The window to reposition before competitors do is closing
- Every month of inaction is a month where prospects bucket you as "web design"
- Research says the runway is 1-2 years, not 5

**Effort:** None

## Decision

**We chose: Option C — "Spark" as parent brand, "Spark Sites" preserved as sub-brand.**

The business has already outgrown the name, but the name still has value. Rather than kill brand equity (Option B) or pretend "Sites" still describes us (Option A) or wait and lose positioning time (Option D), we're committing to a parent brand architecture that matches reality.

"Spark Sites" stays as the website service — it has SEO equity, client recognition, and still describes a real offer. But the parent brand leads. Strategy, education, AI consulting, and growth marketing all live under the parent. The website becomes one entry point among many, not the identity.

### Constraints

- **Parent brand name is TBD.** Could be "Spark Growth," "Spark Marketing," or just "Spark." This is a separate decision — don't rush it.
- **Sub-brands are TBD.** Do not fragment into Spark AI, Spark Ads, Spark Strategy, etc. until the parent brand is established and clear. Build the parent first.
- **Spark Sites is preserved.** Not retired, not renamed. It becomes a sub-brand under the parent.

### Sequencing

1. Decide the parent brand name (separate decision)
2. Build the parent brand identity (positioning, messaging, visual)
3. Soft-launch — start leading with parent brand in new conversations
4. Only then consider whether individual services need sub-brand names

## Consequences

### What Becomes Easier
- Leading with strategy and education in sales conversations
- Positioning for AI consulting and new services
- Marketing the full scope of what we do
- Future service additions slot in naturally under the parent

### What Becomes Harder
- Managing two brand layers (parent + Spark Sites)
- Deciding where each piece of marketing lives
- Explaining the relationship to existing clients during transition

### What We're Accepting
- Short-term complexity while the parent brand gets established
- The parent brand name decision is still ahead of us
- This is a multi-month evolution, not a flip-the-switch rebrand

## What Changes

`core/offer.md` needs updating to reflect the parent brand architecture — the brand-level thesis should describe the parent, not just websites. `reference/domain/product-ladder.md` needs a new top layer showing the parent brand above the current service map. A new decision file will be needed for the parent brand name itself.

Outside reference: no immediate changes to legal, domains, or collateral until the parent brand name is decided.

## Open Questions (Remaining)

1. ~~What should the parent brand be called?~~ **Partially resolved (2026-02-20):** Brand is a variant of "Spark" / "Spark Growth Partner" / "Spark Growth Agency" — exact name TBD. Domain locked: **sparkmygrowth.com**. startwithspark.com remains as vanity/legacy.
2. ~~What does Nicole think about the direction?~~ **Resolved (2026-02-20):** Nicole is in full agreement.
3. ~~How do we introduce the parent brand to existing clients?~~ **Resolved (2026-02-20):** Three-channel rollout — email sequence, organic content, cross-marketing. See `decisions/2026-02-20-parent-brand-rollout-strategy.md`.
4. ~~Does the parent brand need its own website, or does sparkmysite.com evolve?~~ **Resolved (2026-02-20):** Separate WordPress install on sparkmygrowth.com. See decision below.
5. What's the timeline for soft-launching the parent brand?
