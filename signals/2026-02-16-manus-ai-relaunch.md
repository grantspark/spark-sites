# Meta Relaunches Manus AI

## What Happened

Meta relaunched Manus AI under its own brand. It functions as an AI-powered site builder — generates branding, custom graphics (via Nano Banana), page structure, and deploys live sites.

## Why It Matters

- Faster than Netlify for quick deploys — entire funnel from zero to live in one session
- Generates custom branding and graphics without needing a designer
- Lowers the barrier for niche funnel MVPs dramatically
- Potential tool for rapid client prototyping — show a prospect a live site before they sign

## Implications for Spark Sites

- Could use Manus for fast niche funnel experiments (tested with Tropical Horizons)
- Not a replacement for custom client work, but strong for MVPs and proof-of-concepts
- Worth comparing against our /site workflow for speed vs. control tradeoff
