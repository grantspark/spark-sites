# Tropical Horizons — Niche Funnel Experiment

## What Happened

Launched a new funnel targeting **local, boutique high-end hotels in tropical climates** under the brand **Tropical Horizons**.

- **Domain:** TropicalHorizonsMarketing.com
- **Built with:** Meta's Manus AI (relaunched under Meta's brand)
- **Graphics:** Nano Banana (custom AI-generated branding)
- **Time to live:** Same day

## Why It Matters

This is the first test of a rapid niche funnel playbook:

1. Identify an underserved local niche
2. Use AI site builder (Manus) to generate branding + site in one session
3. Deploy and test conversion before investing in custom design

If this converts, the playbook is repeatable across niches — restaurants, med spas, fitness studios, etc. Each gets its own brand identity, built in hours instead of weeks.

## Tools Used

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| Manus (Meta) | Site generation, deployment, structure |
| Nano Banana | Custom branded graphics and imagery |

## What to Watch

- Does the site convert cold traffic?
- Does the boutique hotel niche respond to digital marketing outreach?
- Is the Manus output quality high enough for client-facing work, or just MVPs?

## Next Steps

- Monitor traffic and conversions over 2 weeks
- If promising, document the playbook in `reference/domain/` as a repeatable process
- Consider testing a second niche funnel using the same workflow
