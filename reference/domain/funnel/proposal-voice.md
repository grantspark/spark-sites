# Proposal Voice

How Spark writes proposals. This is the voice and structure for all client-facing quotes, scopes, and project pitches.

---

## Core Principle: Mirror Their Energy

Open every proposal by reflecting specific details from the conversation — their vision, their excitement, their words. This says "I was listening" louder than any credentials section.

**Do this:**
> "It was so great brainstorming with you about the 30th anniversary telethon, the 90s theme, the Jeopardy segment with the mayors, the rewritten theme songs... this event is going to be super fun!"

**Not this:**
> "Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. We appreciate the opportunity to submit this proposal for your consideration."

---

## Structure: Three Tiered Options

Always present three options. The question shifts from "yes or no?" to "which one?"

| Tier | Name Pattern | Role |
|------|-------------|------|
| A | Foundation / Starter / Essentials | Entry — gets the job done |
| B | Campaign / Growth / Professional | Anchor — where most clients land |
| C | Full / Premium / All-In | Aspirational — includes the differentiator |

**Pricing rules:**
- Plain numbers. $1,750 not $1,750.00. No "investment" language.
- Tier C should be ≤2x Tier A — keeps all three in the conversation
- Name the tiers with words that describe what they GET, not service levels

---

## Deliverables: Outcomes, Not Processes

Describe what the client receives in language they'd use, not industry jargon.

**Do this:**
- "Actual hooks (for text posts, but also as scripts for videos) & Copy & Image Prompts"
- "Graphics!"
- "Messaging Session focused solely on capturing and codifying the various messages"

**Not this:**
- "Content strategy development and implementation"
- "Creative asset production"
- "Brand messaging framework deliverable"

Parenthetical asides are good — they show you're thinking out loud about how this helps THEM, not reading from a template.

---

## The Premium Differentiator (Tier C)

The top tier should include something that's clearly consultant-level thinking, not just more deliverables. Something that benefits their WHOLE team, not just the project.

**Example:** "Messaging Development — Messaging Session focused solely on capturing and codifying the various messages (Unify Lakeland, Lakeland's Biggest 90's Telethon, Make an Impact), and preparing those as briefs for the participants."

This pattern: take the strategic work you'd do anyway, name it explicitly, describe how it flows through to their people. That's the premium.

---

## Timeline: Anchor to THEIR Event

Never say "3-month engagement." Always frame the timeline around their milestone.

**Do this:**
> "All three options run March through May to build your audience before the big day"

**Not this:**
> "Proposed timeline: 12 weeks from contract execution"

---

## Tone Markers

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Here's a quick look at what we put together" | "Please find our comprehensive proposal below" |
| "What questions did you have?" | "Please don't hesitate to reach out" |
| "So excited for this one!" | "We look forward to the opportunity" |
| Exclamation points in deliverables | Dry bullet lists |
| "Spark Team" | "Grant Sparks, CEO, Spark Sites LLC" |
| Genuine excitement about THEIR project | Professional distance |

---

## Custom Project Proposals (Events, Campaigns, One-Offs)

For projects that aren't standard website builds:

1. **Open with shared memory** — reference specific creative ideas from the conversation
2. **Name THEIR concepts in the deliverables** — don't genericize. If they said "Jeopardy segment with the mayors," put that in the scope
3. **Show how your work feeds their existing assets** — "translating that into the social content and ad strategy"
4. **Include a management/coordination deliverable** — "5-7 Influencers Managed" or "Day-Of Support" — this is where the real value lives for event clients

## Standard Website Proposals

(To be codified — capture the next website proposal email and add the pattern here.)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Long introductions about Spark's history or credentials
- "Scope of work" as a header (use "Here's what we put together" energy)
- Single option at a single price (always tier)
- Formal sign-offs with titles
- Attachments-only proposals with no email body (the email IS the pitch)
- Passive language ("services would be rendered") instead of active ("we'll build")
