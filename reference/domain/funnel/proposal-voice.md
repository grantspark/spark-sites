# Proposal Voice

How Spark writes proposals. The voice and structure for all client-facing quotes, scopes, and project pitches.

---

## Writing Rules

### Keep sentences short and simple

No compound sentences. No double hyphens. Humans don't type complex sentences in emails. One thought per sentence. The sentiment stays the same. The structure gets simpler.

**Do this:**
> "Here's a quick look at what we put together. Three options depending on how deep you want to go."

**Not this:**
> "Here's a quick look at what we put together — three options depending on how deep you want to go, ranging from ads foundation to the full campaign."

### Name strategy as a service

Every proposal should name the strategic thinking explicitly at least once. This reinforces that Spark is a strategy partner, not just an execution vendor.

**Examples:**
- "Strategy Sessions every other week"
- "Messaging Development Session"
- "Weekly Strategy Calls"
- "Strategic Content Planning"

Don't bury strategy inside other deliverables. Give it its own line item. Clients buy strategy when they can see it.

### Output format

**In conversation (team review):** Plain readable markdown. Headers, bold, bullets — whatever reads well.

**In ClickUp comments:** Plain text. No HTML (ClickUp doesn't render it). Use line breaks for spacing and dashes for list items. Keep it simple and readable.

**In email:** Basic HTML for email clients. Use `<b>`, `<br>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`. No headers or horizontal rules. The way a real email looks.

## Core Principle: Mirror Their Energy

Open every proposal by reflecting specific details from the conversation. Their vision. Their excitement. Their words. This says "I was listening" louder than any credentials section.

**Do this:**
> "It was so great brainstorming with you about the 30th anniversary telethon, the 90s theme, the Jeopardy segment with the mayors, the rewritten theme songs... this event is going to be super fun!"

**Not this:**
> "Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. We appreciate the opportunity to submit this proposal for your consideration."

## Structure: Three Tiered Options

Always present three options. The question shifts from "yes or no?" to "which one?"

| Tier | Name Pattern | Role |
|------|-------------|------|
| A | Foundation / Starter / Essentials | Entry. Gets the job done. |
| B | Campaign / Growth / Professional | Anchor. Where most clients land. |
| C | Full / Premium / All-In | Aspirational. Includes the differentiator. |

**Pricing rules:**
- Plain numbers. $1,750 not $1,750.00. No "investment" language.
- Tier C should be no more than 2x Tier A. Keeps all three in the conversation.
- Name the tiers with words that describe what they GET. Not service levels.

---

## Deliverables: Outcomes, Not Processes

Describe what the client receives in language they'd use. Not industry jargon.

**Do this:**
- "Actual hooks (for text posts, but also as scripts for videos)"
- "Copy and Image Prompts"
- "Graphics!"
- "Messaging Session focused on capturing and codifying the various messages"

**Not this:**
- "Content strategy development and implementation"
- "Creative asset production"
- "Brand messaging framework deliverable"

Parenthetical asides are fine. They show you're thinking about how this helps THEM. Not reading from a template.

---

## The Premium Differentiator (Tier C)

The top tier includes something that's clearly strategy-level thinking. Not just more deliverables. Something that benefits their whole team, not just the project.

**Example:** "Messaging Development. A strategy session focused on capturing and codifying the various messages (Unify Lakeland, Lakeland's Biggest 90's Telethon, Make an Impact). We prepare those as briefs for the participants so they can carry the message in their own channels."

The pattern: take the strategic work you'd do anyway. Name it. Describe how it flows through to their people. That's the premium.

---

## Timeline: Anchor to THEIR Event

Never say "3-month engagement." Frame the timeline around their milestone.

**Do this:**
> "All three options run March through May to build your audience before the big day"

**Not this:**
> "Proposed timeline: 12 weeks from contract execution"

---

## Tone Markers

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Here's a quick look at what we put together" | "Please find our comprehensive proposal below" |
| "What questions did you have?" | "Please don't hesitate to reach out" |
| "So excited for this one!" | "We look forward to the opportunity" |
| Exclamation points in deliverables | Dry bullet lists |
| "Spark Team" | "Grant Sparks, CEO, Spark Sites LLC" |
| Genuine excitement about THEIR project | Professional distance |

---

## Custom Project Proposals (Events, Campaigns, One-Offs)

For projects that aren't standard website builds:

1. **Open with shared memory.** Reference specific creative ideas from the conversation.
2. **Name THEIR concepts in the deliverables.** Don't genericize. If they said "Jeopardy segment with the mayors," put that in the scope.
3. **Show how your work feeds their existing assets.** "Translating that into the social content and ad strategy."
4. **Include a management deliverable.** "5-7 Influencers Managed" or "Day-Of Support." This is where the real value lives for event clients.
5. **Name the strategy.** At least one line item should say "Strategy" explicitly. Clients remember what they see named.

## Standard Website Proposals

(To be codified. Capture the next website proposal email and add the pattern here.)

## Anti-Patterns

- Compound sentences joined with hyphens or dashes
- Long introductions about Spark's history or credentials
- "Scope of work" as a header (use "Here's what we put together" energy)
- Single option at a single price (always tier)
- Formal sign-offs with titles
- Attachments-only proposals with no email body (the email IS the pitch)
- Passive language ("services would be rendered") instead of active ("we'll build")
- HTML formatting in ClickUp comments (doesn't render — use plain text)
- Markdown formatting in emails (use basic HTML for email clients)
