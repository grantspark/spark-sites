## Cross-Sell / Upsell Quick Reference

Derived from the product ladder. Use during proposal generation to identify implicit needs.

| Client Asks For | Always Consider Adding | Signal to Watch For |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Website | SEO, Google Business setup, Content Bot | "I need people to find me" = SEO. "I sell online" = e-commerce + ads |
| MLS/IDX install | Local SEO, Google Ads (homebuyer keywords), site navigation updates | Real estate = high search intent, ads almost always make sense |
| SEO | Google Ads (bridge traffic while SEO builds), Content Bot | "I need leads now" = ads are urgent, not just SEO |
| Google Ads | Facebook Ads, landing page optimization | Poor conversion rate = site needs work first |
| Facebook Ads | Google Ads, social media management | "We post but nobody sees it" = organic needs help too |
| Social media | Facebook Ads (boost winners), content strategy consult | No content plan = needs consulting first |
| Influencer event | Social management, Facebook Ads (amplify content) | One-time event mindset = pitch ongoing relationship |
| Consulting | The service itself (they often want someone to do it) | "This is a lot of work" = they'll hire you |
| "Just a small update" | Audit the whole site — often reveals bigger needs | Outdated site, broken links, no mobile optimization |

---

## Implicit Need Signals

Beyond explicit requests, watch for these in conversations, call transcripts, and intake forms:

| Signal | Implicit Need |
|--------|--------------|
| "Nobody can find us online" | SEO + Google Business optimization |
| "We get traffic but no calls/sales" | Conversion optimization, possibly ads landing pages |
| "We're on social but it's not working" | Social strategy consult before management |
| "Our competitor shows up above us" | SEO + possibly Google Ads |
| "We just opened / we're opening soon" | Full launch package: website + Google Business + social + possibly influencer event |
| "We need to update our website" | Audit first — often reveals need for rebuild, not just edits |
| "We want to run ads" | Do they have a website that converts? If not, site first |
| "We need a brand refresh" | Website + social + possibly new messaging (consulting) |
| "We're adding a new service/product" | Website updates + content + possibly ads for the new offering |
| Client has a physical location | Google Business, local SEO, influencer events |
| Client sells online | E-commerce site, Google Shopping, Facebook/Instagram ads |
| Client mentions events or launches | Influencer event + social + ads |
| Real estate / property business | MLS/IDX, local SEO, Google Ads (high intent keywords), neighborhood pages |

## Proposal Packaging Principles

1. **Quote what they asked for** — always lead with the explicit request
2. **Recommend what they need** — add-ons and upsells framed as recommendations, not hard sells
3. **Bundle for value** — packaged pricing beats line-item nickel-and-diming
4. **Phase when appropriate** — "Phase 1: Website. Phase 2: SEO + Ads" feels manageable, not overwhelming
5. **Show the connection** — explain WHY the upsell matters ("Your MLS install will drive more listings, but people need to find those listings — that's where local SEO comes in")
