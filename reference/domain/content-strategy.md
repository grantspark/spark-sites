# Content Strategy

*This file is scaffolded. Use `/think` to develop your content pillars, platforms, and cadence.*

## Content Pillars

*(Define 3-5 recurring themes for content)*

1. **Education** — Teaching small businesses marketing fundamentals
2. **Local Business Spotlights** — Showcasing Lakeland businesses and clients
3. **Behind the Scenes** — Team, process, culture
4. **Results/Case Studies** — What we've done for clients
5. TBD

## Platforms

| Platform | Purpose | Cadence |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Website/Blog | SEO, authority | TBD |
| Facebook | Community, local | TBD |
| Instagram | Visual, behind-scenes | TBD |
| LinkedIn | B2B, credibility | TBD |
| Email | Nurture, education | TBD |

## Cadence

*(Define posting frequency)*

TBD — use `/think` to determine sustainable cadence.

## Top-of-Funnel

- Webinars (need to restart)
- Educational library (coming soon)
- Blog content via Content Bot
- Local workshops

## Metrics to Track

- Website traffic
- Lead form submissions
- Webinar registrations
- Email list growth
- Social engagement

## Notes

Content strategy needs development. Current focus is service delivery — content is opportunistic rather than systematic.
