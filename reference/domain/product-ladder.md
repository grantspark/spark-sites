## Entry Points

### 1. Websites (Primary)
Most clients find us looking for a website. The site is the wedge — once built, we schedule a discovery call to understand their broader needs.

**Typical flow:** Website → Discovery → SEO or Ads or Social

### 2. SEO / AI Optimization
Some clients come seeking rankings specifically. We serve that need, then parlay into ads management once they see results.

**Typical flow:** SEO → Results → Ads management

### 3. Education (Webinars/Courses)
Webinars pull people into our ecosystem by demonstrating expertise. Attendees become clients when they realize they'd rather hire us than DIY.

**Typical flow:** Webinar → Follow-up → Service engagement

### 4. Influencer Events
Nicole handles soft openings and influencer networking. These are project-based and often lead to ongoing marketing relationships.

**Typical flow:** Event → Relationship → Ongoing services

## The Discovery Call

The discovery call is the key mechanism. Framed as a "marketing consultation," it surfaces:
- What the client actually needs (vs. what they asked for)
- Budget and timeline realities
- Upsell opportunities (SEO, ads, social, consulting)

This is where most upselling happens.

## Upsell Paths

| From | Natural upsell to |
|------|------------------|
| Website | SEO, Ads, Social, All-Inclusive |
| SEO | Google Ads, Facebook Ads |
| Ads | Social media management |
| Any service | Strategy/consulting sessions |
| Webinar attendee | Website or SEO |

## Gaps to Address

- **Strategy sessions** need productizing (currently embedded in other services)
- **Educational library** not yet launched — will become a major entry point
- **Webinars** paused — need to restart as top-of-funnel
