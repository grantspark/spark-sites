## The Starter Site (New Primary Entry Point)

The Starter Site is the lowest-friction entry into our ecosystem. We build it BEFORE the prospect signs up — they see a live, professional website with their business name on it during the first cold call. No design fee, no setup fee. They just pay to keep it live.

**What it is:** A custom single-page website, already built and deployed, shown to the prospect on the sales call.

**What the customer pays:**
- Hosting: ~$25/mo
- Domain: ~$20/yr
- Optional: Google Business Profile optimization

**Why it works:** Seeing a live site with their name on it converts cold leads who would never pay $500-$900 upfront for a website they can't visualize. The site is real. The value is immediate. The commitment is minimal.

**Typical flow:** Cold call with live demo → Starter Site ($25/mo) → Google Business add-on → Discovery call → Website upgrade or marketing services

## Entry Points

### 1. Starter Site (Primary — Lowest Friction)
Demo Drop builds the site before the call. The prospect sees it live. If they want it, they pay hosting + domain. No upfront cost removes the biggest objection.

**Typical flow:** Starter Site → Add-ons (Google Business, Social) → Discovery → Upgrade or Marketing Services

### 2. Strategy Sessions ($350)
Structured 90-minute sessions with homework and a written deliverable. Topics: Messaging, SEO, Social Media, Ads, Funnel, AI/Automation. Clients enter here when they need direction before committing to execution.

**Typical flow:** Strategy Session → Clarity → Execution service (Website, SEO, Ads)

### 3. Website Projects (Direct)
Some clients come ready to invest in a full website. They skip the Starter Site and go straight to a paid tier.

**Typical flow:** Website ($500–$2,500+) → Discovery → SEO or Ads or Social

### 4. SEO / AI Optimization
Some clients come seeking rankings specifically. We serve that need, then parlay into ads management once they see results.

**Typical flow:** SEO → Results → Ads management

### 5. Education (Webinars/Courses)
Webinars pull people into our ecosystem by demonstrating expertise. Attendees become clients when they realize they'd rather hire us than DIY.

**Typical flow:** Webinar → Follow-up → Service engagement

### 6. Influencer Events
Nicole handles soft openings and influencer networking. These are project-based and often lead to ongoing marketing relationships.

**Typical flow:** Event → Relationship → Ongoing services

## Website Tiers

| Tier | Price | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Starter Site** | $25/mo hosting + $20/yr domain | Single-page site, built before the call |
| Links Page | $500 | Custom one-page, link-in-bio style |
| Starter | $900 | 1–3 page website |
| Multi-Page | $1,500–$2,500 | Full business website |
| E-commerce | $2,500+ | WooCommerce, full online store |
| All-Inclusive | $3,500+ | Website + Google Business + MailChimp + marketing |

## The Discovery Call

The discovery call is the key mechanism. Framed as a "marketing consultation," it surfaces:
- What the client actually needs (vs. what they asked for)
- Budget and timeline realities
- Upsell opportunities (SEO, ads, social, consulting)

This is where most upselling happens. Starter Site clients get a discovery call after their first month — once they've seen the value.

## Upsell Paths

| From | Natural upsell to |
|------|------------------|
| **Starter Site** | Google Business Profile, Social Setup, Strategy Session, Multi-Page Website, SEO |
| **Strategy Session** | Execution service for the topic (Website, SEO, Ads, Social), another session on a different topic |
| Website project | SEO, Ads, Social, All-Inclusive |
| SEO | Google Ads, Facebook Ads |
| Ads | Social media management |
| Any service | Strategy sessions ($350), All-Inclusive |
| Webinar attendee | Starter Site, Strategy Session, or Website |

### Starter Site Upsell Ladder

The Starter Site is designed as a stepping stone. Each add-on increases monthly value:

```
Starter Site ($25/mo)
  ├── + Google Business Profile (one-time)
  ├── + Social Media Setup (one-time)
  ├── + Custom Domain Email (one-time)
  │
  ├──▶ Multi-Page Website Upgrade ($900+)
  │     └── Now on a real website tier with more pages, features
  │
  ├──▶ SEO Package ($500–$1K/mo)
  │     └── Get found on Google for their services
  │
  └──▶ All-Inclusive Package ($3,500+)
        └── Everything managed — site, SEO, ads, email, social
```

**Key insight:** The Starter Site removes the "I need to think about it" objection. The site is already built. The prospect just decides whether to keep it.

## Strategy Session Upsell Ladder

Strategy sessions sit at the decision layer — they help clients figure out what they need before spending on execution.

```
Strategy Session ($350)
  ├── Messaging → Website project ($900+), Content Strategy Session
  ├── SEO → SEO retainer ($500-$1K/mo), Content Bot ($1,200 setup)
  ├── Social Media → Social management ($500-$2K/mo), Facebook Ads
  ├── Ads → Ads management ($350 setup + monthly), landing page
  ├── Funnel → Website + Email marketing + Ads (bundled)
  ├── AI/Automation → Content Bot, workflow implementation
  │
  ├── Stack sessions: Messaging + Content Strategy = stronger foundation
  │
  └── Quick Audit ($120) as downsell when $350 is too much
      DIY Worksheet (free) as lead magnet
```

## Gaps to Address

- ~~Strategy sessions need productizing~~ → Done. See `offers/strategy/`
- **Educational library** not yet launched — will become a major entry point
- **Webinars** paused — need to restart as top-of-funnel
- **Starter Site add-on pricing** — need to finalize one-time prices for Google Business, Social Setup, Domain Email
- **Session bundles** — consider pricing for 2-3 session packages (Messaging + Content Strategy, etc.)
