- Meta relaunched Manus AI under its own brand — AI-powered site builder
- Faster than Netlify for quick funnel deploys — generates branding, graphics, and deploys in one shot
- Used Nano Banana for custom image generation within the workflow

- Brand name: **Tropical Horizons** (TropicalHorizonsMarketing.com)

- Signal: if this converts, it's a repeatable playbook — pick a niche, generate a funnel, test in a day
