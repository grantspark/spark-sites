# Visual Style

## Brand Aesthetic

**Solarpunk** — A hopeful, technological view of the future. Not dystopian tech, but tech that serves humanity and communities.

**Florida-influenced** — Bright, warm, sun-drenched. The colors and light of Central Florida.

**Accessible futurism** — Technology that feels welcoming, not intimidating.

## Color Palette

Bright, gradient-forward, white-space-dominant. The palette reflects Florida energy — not earthy or muted.

| Role | Color | Hex | Usage |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| Background | White | #FFFFFF | Primary page background — generous white space |
| Text | Dark charcoal | #1C1C1C | Body copy, headings |
| Primary gradient start | Coral | #FF6B47 | Left/top of signature gradient |
| Primary gradient end | Hot pink | #E91E8C | Right/bottom of signature gradient |
| CTA | Coral-to-pink gradient | #FF6B47 → #E91E8C | Buttons, primary actions (sacred — nothing else uses this gradient) |
| Section dark | Deep navy | #1A1A2E | CTA banner backgrounds, footer |
| Section dark text | Near-white | #F2F1EF | Text on dark sections |
| Card border | Light gray | #E8E5DF | Subtle card/section borders |
| Muted text | Gray | #6B7280 | Secondary copy, descriptions |
| Accent decorative | Pink/coral tints | #FFE8E2 | Background tints behind photos, decorative elements |

### Gradient Rules

- **Signature gradient:** `linear-gradient(135deg, #FF6B47, #E91E8C)` — used for CTA buttons, hero accents, section dividers
- **Decorative gradient:** Same hues at 10-20% opacity — behind photos, as subtle section backgrounds
- **Never:** Blue-to-purple gradients. Muted earth tones as primary palette.

## Typography

| Role | Font | Weight | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Display / Headings | Fraunces | 700-900 | Warm serif with character — approachable authority |
| Body | DM Sans | 400-600 | Clean humanist sans — readable, not generic |

### Typography Rules

- Headlines are bold and large — the page reads headline-first
- Body copy has generous line height (1.6-1.7) for readability
- No Inter, Roboto, Arial, Poppins, or Helvetica — these read as generic AI output

## Photography Style

- Bright, natural lighting
- Real local business settings
- People genuinely working/collaborating
- Technology integrated naturally, not staged
- Florida landscapes and business environments

## Visual Don'ts

- No dark, dystopian tech imagery
- No cold, corporate stock photos
- No overly polished/fake smiles
- No generic "business people shaking hands"
- No imagery that feels intimidating or exclusive

## Mood Board Keywords

- Sunrise over Lakeland
- Small business storefronts
- Laptops in bright cafes
- Solar panels and green tech
- Community gatherings
- Warm, golden hour lighting

## Design Principles

- **White space is a feature** — generous breathing room between sections, not cramped
- **Gradient is the signature** — coral-to-pink gradient is the visual fingerprint of Spark
- **Bright over earthy** — Florida energy, not Pacific Northwest earthiness
- **Photos get color treatment** — circular crops with gradient tints behind them
- **Dark sections are punctuation** — used sparingly for CTA banners, not as default

## Evolution Notes

The visual identity has evolved over time. Current direction emphasizes the solarpunk aesthetic — hopeful, bright, Florida-rooted, tech-positive. The coral-to-pink gradient emerged as the brand's signature visual element, carried forward from the HotSpark era into the Spark parent brand.
