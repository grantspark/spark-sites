## Known Gap: Under-Productized

Currently, a lot of consulting happens embedded in other services — especially during discovery calls and client onboarding. This leaves money on the table.

**To fix:**
- Create clear packages (not just hourly)
- Promote strategy sessions as standalone products
- Build intake process for strategy-only clients
