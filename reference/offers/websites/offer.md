# Websites

## What It Is

Custom website design and development for small businesses. From a free Starter Site shown on the first call to full e-commerce solutions.

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Starter Site** | $25/mo hosting + ~$20/yr domain | Single-page site, built before the sales call |
| Links Page | $500 | Custom one-page, link-in-bio style |
| Starter | $900 | 1–3 page website |
| Multi-Page | $1,500–$2,500 | Full business website |
| E-commerce | $2,500+ | WooCommerce, full online store |
| All-Inclusive | $3,500+ | Website + Google Business + MailChimp + marketing |

## What's Included

**Starter Site:**
- Custom single-page website (already built before the call)
- Mobile responsive
- Click-to-call phone button
- Services, about, and contact sections
- Professional industry-matched design
- Managed hosting with 24/7 support, backups, and SSL

**All paid tiers ($500+):**
- Custom design (not templates)
- Mobile responsive
- Basic SEO setup
- Training on how to update

**Higher tiers add:**
- More pages and functionality
- E-commerce integration
- Email marketing setup
- Ongoing support

## The Upsell Path

The Starter Site is the new primary entry point. It removes price objections entirely — the site is already built, the prospect just decides whether to keep it.

**Starter Site path:**
1. Prospect sees live site on cold call → signs up for hosting
2. Offer add-ons: Google Business Profile, Social Media Setup, Domain Email
3. Schedule discovery call after first month
4. Upgrade to multi-page site or add marketing services

**Direct website path (clients ready to invest):**
1. Schedule discovery call (framed as marketing consultation)
2. Surface additional needs
3. Upsell to SEO, ads, social, or all-inclusive package

## Differentiators

- Custom design, not cookie-cutter templates
- Education built into the process
- Local (Lakeland) expertise
- Tech depth from 20+ years experience
- Fair pricing for small business budgets

## Common Objections

**"Can't I just use Wix/Squarespace?"**
You can, but you'll hit limitations fast. We build something that grows with your business and ranks better on Google.

**"Why should I pay this when I can get a $200 website?"**
Cheap websites look cheap. Your website is often the first impression — it should reflect the quality of your business.
