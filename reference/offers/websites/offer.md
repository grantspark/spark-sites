## Common Objections

**"Can't I just use Wix/Squarespace?"**
You can, but you'll hit limitations fast. We build something that grows with your business and ranks better on Google.

**"Why should I pay this when I can get a $200 website?"**
Cheap websites look cheap. Your website is often the first impression — it should reflect the quality of your business.
