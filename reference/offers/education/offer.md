# Education

## What It Is

Courses, trainings, webinars, and an educational library teaching small businesses how to market themselves.

## Status

**Not yet launched.** Currently in planning phase.

## Planned Offerings

- How to rank on Google
- How to market your small business

- General digital marketing fundamentals

## Pricing

TBD — likely:
- Free tier (lead magnet content)
- Low-cost courses ($50–$200)
- Premium programs ($500+)
- Live workshops (varies)

## Strategic Role

Education is a **core differentiator** and **top-of-funnel entry point**:

1. Free content demonstrates expertise
2. Webinars pull people into ecosystem
3. Attendees become clients when they'd rather hire us than DIY
4. Courses create recurring revenue beyond services

## Connection to Core Values

**Educate** — This IS the core value in action
**Empower** — Giving business owners the knowledge to succeed
**Encourage** — Supporting their journey, not just selling

## History

- Have done webinars in the past as part of value funnel
- Webinars effectively led to upsells
- Been dormant recently — need to restart

## What's Needed to Launch

- Define first 2-3 course topics
- Build course content
- Set up delivery platform
- Create marketing funnel for courses
- Resume webinar schedule
