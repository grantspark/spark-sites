# Strategy Session Framework

A reusable template for building structured 90-minute strategy sessions on any topic. Extracted from the Messaging Strategy Session — the first session we fully productized.

---

## The Pattern

Every strategy session follows the same structure, regardless of topic. What changes is the subject matter — the bones stay the same.

### Why This Works

1. **Homework forces thinking.** Clients who prepare get 3x more value from the session. The homework IS part of the product.
2. **Structure prevents rambling.** 90 minutes without structure becomes a free-form therapy session. The 5-block format keeps it productive.
3. **The deliverable is the product.** The call is the process. The written guide is what the client keeps, shares, and acts on. Price the deliverable, not the hour.
4. **Every session surfaces execution needs.** Not by selling — by clarifying. Once someone understands their messaging, they see their website needs work. Once they understand SEO, they want help implementing. The education creates the demand.

## Universal Pre-Session Homework Template

Send 3-5 days before. 4-6 questions. Should take the client 20-30 minutes.

**Always include these two:**
- "Bring examples you admire" — forces them to think about what good looks like
- "Bring what you currently have" — gives you the starting point to improve

**The other 3-4 questions should:**
- Be answerable without expertise (gut reactions, not analysis)
- Reveal the gap between where they are and where they want to be
- Surface the client's own language (which becomes the deliverable's language)
- Include one question that feels slightly uncomfortable — that's where the real insight lives

**Example pattern:**
1. How do you currently [do the thing]? (baseline)
2. What frustrates you about [the thing]? (pain)
3. What would [the thing] look like if it were working perfectly? (desired outcome)
4. What have you tried that didn't work? (context + objection prevention)
5. Show me examples of [the thing] done well (taste + aspiration)
6. Bring your current [materials] (starting point)

## Universal Session Structure (90 Minutes)

| Block | Time | Purpose | Key Behavior |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Review & Warm-Up | 15 min | Walk through homework. Listen, don't correct. | Note their natural language — it's better than jargon. |
| 2. Core Workshop | 25 min | Build the central framework for this topic. | Use fill-in templates, then break the templates. |
| 3. Mapping | 15 min | Translate between their world and the technical world. | "Say this, not that" tables. Jargon → plain language. |
| 4. Extraction | 20 min | Pull out the unique, defensible, provable elements. | Apply the competitor test: "Would someone else say this?" |
| 5. Synthesis | 15 min | Recap, confirm, and outline next steps. | Read it back. Does it feel right? Then explain where it applies. |

**Block 2 is the custom part.** The other four blocks are nearly identical across all session types — just swap the subject matter.

## Universal Upsell Logic

Every session leads to execution. Map it before building the session:

```
[Strategy Session on Topic X]
  ├── Cross-sell: Starter Site, Google Business, Social Setup
  ├── Upsell: Execution service for Topic X
  ├── Stack: Another session on a related topic
  └── Package: All-Inclusive ($3,500+)
```

## Learnings from the Messaging Session (Apply to All)

1. **The homework question they resist most reveals the biggest gap.** Ask about it gently in Block 1.
2. **Customer language beats industry language every time.** Build the deliverable in their words, not yours.
3. **The competitor test is universal.** "Would a competitor say the same thing?" works for messaging, SEO, social — any topic where differentiation matters.
4. **Don't sell in the session.** Educate. The clarity you create naturally surfaces the next need. If you have to push, the session didn't do its job.
5. **The deliverable is what gets shared.** The client shows the written guide to their partner, their team, their other vendors. Make it clean, scannable, and standalone.
6. **Record the session.** With permission. The best material comes out in conversation, not in structured answers. Use the recording to write a better deliverable.
