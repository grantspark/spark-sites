# Messaging Strategy Session

## What It Is

A structured 90-minute session that helps a business owner find and articulate their core message — the thing that makes someone stop scrolling, lean in, and say "that's exactly what I need."

Most small business owners know what they do. They struggle to say why it matters. This session fixes that.

**Price:** $350 (session + written deliverable)

**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Deliverable:** Written Messaging Guide delivered within 48 hours

## Pre-Session Homework

Sent 3-5 days before the session. The homework is the engine — if the client shows up cold, half the session is spent extracting basics. These questions force them to think before the call.

### Send This to the Client:

> **Before our session, please spend 20-30 minutes on these. Don't overthink — gut reactions are often the best material.**
>
> 1. **What do you say when someone asks "what do you do?"** Write it exactly as you'd say it at a barbecue, not how you'd write it on a business card.
>
> 2. **List 3 things your best customers have said about you.** Pull from Google reviews, texts, DMs, emails, or just from memory. Exact words are gold.
>
> 3. **What do your competitors say that makes you roll your eyes?** What claims feel hollow, overused, or dishonest in your industry?
>
> 4. **If you could only tell a stranger ONE thing about your business, what would it be?** Not a tagline — just the one thing you'd want them to walk away knowing.
>
> 5. **Send 2-3 examples of messaging you admire** from any business in any industry. Tell me what you like about each one.
>
> 6. **Bring any existing marketing materials** — your website, social bios, flyers, business cards, email signatures. Whatever you currently use to describe your business.

## Session Structure (90 Minutes)

### Block 1 — Review & Warm-Up (15 min)

Walk through their homework answers together. Don't correct — listen. Pay attention to:
- The language they use naturally (not the polished version)
- Where they light up vs. where they sound rehearsed
- Gaps between what they say and what their customers say about them
- The "barbecue answer" vs. the "business card answer" — the gap is where the real message lives

**Key question:** "Which of your homework answers felt hardest to write? That's usually where the interesting stuff is."

### Block 2 — Core Message Workshop (25 min)

Extract the building blocks of their message:

1. **Who do you serve?** Not demographics — the person. "Busy moms who..." not "Women 25-45."
2. **What problem do you solve?** The felt problem, not the technical one. "They're embarrassed by their website" not "They need responsive design."
3. **What outcome do you deliver?** After working with you, what changes? Be specific.
4. **What makes you different?** Why you and not the other option? (We'll pressure-test this in Block 4.)

Craft 2-3 versions of a core message statement:
- **Formal:** For the website hero, proposals, LinkedIn
- **Conversational:** For networking, social media, casual intros
- **Elevator pitch:** 10 seconds, one breath

**Template to fill:** "I help [who] [solve what problem] so they can [achieve what outcome]."

Then break the template. The best messages don't sound like templates.

### Block 3 — Audience Language Map (15 min)

Build a "say this, not that" reference using their customer quotes from homework:

| They say (customer language) | You say (industry jargon) | Use this instead |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "I need help getting found online" | "SEO optimization" | "Get found on Google" |
| "My website looks outdated" | "UI/UX refresh" | "A website that matches your quality" |

**The rule:** If a customer wouldn't say it, don't put it in your marketing.

Pull directly from their Google reviews, testimonials, and homework answers. The best copy is stolen from the customer's mouth.

### Block 4 — Differentiator Extraction (20 min)

Identify 3-5 real differentiators. For each one, apply the test:

**"Would a competitor say the same thing?"**
- "Great customer service" → Yes, everyone says this. Dig deeper. What specifically?
- "We explain everything we do so you're never confused" → Better. That's specific and testable.

For each validated differentiator, find the proof point:
- A story, a testimonial, a number, a process — something concrete that makes it real
- If there's no proof point, it's an aspiration, not a differentiator (yet)

**Categories to explore:**
- Process (how you work differently)
- Philosophy (what you believe that others don't)
- Results (what you deliver that others can't or won't)
- Experience (what it feels like to work with you)
- Credentials (what you bring that's hard to replicate)

### Block 5 — Synthesis & Next Steps (15 min)

Recap what we built:
- Read back the core message versions — do they feel right?
- Review the language map — anything to add?
- Confirm the differentiators — rank them by impact

Explain where this applies:
- Website hero section and about page
- Social media bios
- Google Business Profile description
- Elevator pitch and networking
- Ad copy and content
- Proposals and sales conversations

Outline what's next (don't sell — educate on options):
- If they need a website or website refresh → explain how the message informs design
- If they're doing their own content → the language map is their cheat sheet
- If they want help executing → describe relevant services

## Internal Notes

- The homework is non-negotiable. If a client shows up without doing it, spend the first 20 minutes doing it together — but flag that the session will be shorter as a result.
- Record the session (with permission) so the deliverable is accurate — don't rely on notes alone.
- The deliverable is the product, not the call. The call is the process. Price accordingly.
- This session naturally surfaces website and content needs. Don't push — the client will ask.
