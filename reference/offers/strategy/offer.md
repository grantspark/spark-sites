# Strategy & Consulting

## What It Is

Structured strategy sessions that help small business owners make better decisions about their marketing — before spending money on execution. Each session focuses on one topic, includes pre-session homework, and delivers a written guide the client can act on.

This is the education-first model in action: we teach them to think clearly about their business, then help them execute if they want us to.

## Pricing

| Service | Price | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Strategy Session | $350 | 90-min structured session + written deliverable (48 hrs) |
| Quick Audit | $120 | 30-min review of one thing + 3 actionable fixes |
| Hourly Support | $120/hr | Follow-up work, implementation questions, ad-hoc consulting |

## Available Session Topics

| Session | What It Solves |
|---------|---------------|
| **Messaging** | "I can't explain what I do in a way that makes people care" |
| SEO Strategy | "I don't know how to get found on Google" |
| Social Media Strategy | "I'm posting but nothing's working" |
| Ads Strategy | "I want to run ads but don't know where to start" |
| Funnel Strategy | "I don't understand how customers go from finding me to buying" |
| AI/Automation Strategy | "I keep hearing about AI but don't know what applies to my business" |

**Bold = fully productized.** Others follow the same framework (see `strategy-session-framework.md`) and will be detailed as client demand materializes.

## What Every Session Includes

- Pre-session homework (sent 3-5 days before)
- 90-minute structured session with a trained strategist
- Written guide delivered within 48 hours
- Clear next steps — whether DIY or with us

## How It Fits the Ladder

Strategy sessions sit at the decision layer. They help a client figure out what they need before committing to execution. This means:

- **Entry from below:** Starter Site clients and free workshop attendees who want guidance before spending more
- **Entry from the side:** Referrals, Google searchers looking for "marketing consultant Lakeland"
- **Exit upward:** The session naturally surfaces execution needs — website, SEO, ads, content — that we can fulfill

The session is never a hard sell. The deliverable stands alone. If the client wants to DIY with the guide, that's a win — they'll come back when they're ready for execution.

## Downsells (When $350 Is Too Much)

- **DIY Worksheet (Free)** — Self-guided version of the homework. Lead magnet / email capture.
- **30-Min Quick Audit ($120)** — One focused review with 3 fixes. No deliverable doc.

## Cross-Sells (Pair With)

- Starter Site ($25/mo) — put the strategy into action immediately
- Google Business Profile optimization — quick win alongside the session
- Social Media Setup — apply session learnings to all profiles

## Upsells (After the Session)

- Website project ($900+) — built on the strategy
- Monthly SEO or Ads management — execute the plan
- Another strategy session on a different topic — stack sessions
- All-Inclusive Package ($3,500+) — full execution across everything

## Differentiators

- **Not just advice — a deliverable.** Every session produces a written guide, not just a conversation.
- **Homework-driven.** The client thinks before the call, which means the session is deeper and more productive.
- **Education-first.** The goal is understanding, not dependency. If they can DIY after the session, we did our job.
- **Nicole's academic credibility.** A Professor of Marketing running your strategy session isn't something other local agencies offer.
