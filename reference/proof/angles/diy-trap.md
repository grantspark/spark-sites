# DIY Trap

**Hook:** "You started with Wix because it was free. Now you're spending 10 hours a week fighting a website that still looks like a template."

## The Angle

Speaks to entrepreneurs who chose the DIY route — Wix, Squarespace, Canva, WordPress.com — because it seemed affordable and manageable. Over time, the hidden costs stack up: time lost customizing, SEO limitations, design that doesn't reflect their business quality, plugin headaches, and the nagging feeling that their website is holding them back.

The trap isn't the tools — the tools work for some people. The trap is the assumption that "doing it yourself" is actually saving money when your time has real value.

## Who This Resonates With

- Entrepreneurs who've spent 20+ hours building a site that still doesn't look right
- Business owners whose website doesn't match the quality of their actual work
- Founders who keep meaning to "fix the website" but never have time
- Anyone who's hit the ceiling of what template-based platforms can do

## Emotional Core

Frustration + self-awareness. They know the website isn't good enough. They've been telling themselves "I'll fix it this weekend" for months. They're ready to admit that doing it themselves isn't working — but they need permission to let go of the sunk cost.

## Supporting Evidence

- Common objection in audience.md: "Can't I just do this myself with Wix/Squarespace?"
- Offer differentiator: Custom design, not cookie-cutter templates
- Price reframe: Compare hours spent DIY vs. cost of professional build

## Compliance Notes

- Low compliance burden (mechanism/process angle, no outcome claims)
- Safe for all platforms
- Avoid disparaging specific platforms by name in ad copy — focus on the experience, not the tool

## Pairs Well With

- **Education First** — "We'll teach you what actually matters so you stop wasting time on the wrong things"
- **Burned by Agencies** — "You went DIY because the last agency burned you. We're different."
- **Local Trust** — "You don't need a faceless website builder. You need a Lakeland team."
