# Angle: Burned by Agencies

## The Hook

"You've already wasted money on marketing that didn't work. Let's talk about why."

## The Insight

Most small business owners in Lakeland have already tried hiring someone for their website or marketing — a cheap freelancer on Fiverr, a flashy agency that overpromised, or a nephew who "knows computers." The result: money spent, nothing to show for it, and now they're skeptical of everyone. That skepticism is valid. We don't fight it — we earn our way past it by showing our work and explaining every step.

## Key Messages

- We know you've been burned — that's why we explain everything
- No black-box marketing. You see what we're doing and why
- We don't disappear after the invoice clears
- Your skepticism is healthy. We welcome it
- We build trust through transparency, not promises

## Proof Points

- Discovery calls focused on education, not pressure
- Grant has been building websites since 2004 — not a fly-by-night operation
- Spark Sites founded in 2018 and still growing in Lakeland
- Clients stay because they understand the value, not because they're locked in

## Use In

- Facebook/Instagram ads targeting business owners who've tried agencies before
- Retargeting (they visited the site but didn't book — skepticism is the blocker)
- Objection handling in sales conversations
- Landing page copy for discovery call bookings

## Supporting Testimonial

> "We appreciate the time he spent with us to really understand our business objectives and the thoughtful guidance he gave us." — Sarah Mulcahy

## Awareness Level

**Problem-aware to solution-aware.** They know marketing hasn't worked for them. They may not know a transparent, education-first agency exists.
