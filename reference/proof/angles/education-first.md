# Angle: Education First

## The Hook

"The more you understand, the more you'll value what we do."

## The Insight

Most agencies hide behind jargon and complexity. They want clients to feel dependent, not empowered. We flip that — we teach because educated clients make better decisions and stay longer.

## Key Messages

- We explain everything in plain language
- Your marketing shouldn't be a mystery
- Understanding what you're paying for = trusting us more
- We're guides, not gatekeepers

## Proof Points

- Nicole is literally a Professor of Marketing
- Free workshops at Cohatch
- Webinars that teach before they sell
- Discovery calls focused on education, not pressure

## Use In

- Website copy
- Workshop promotion
- Differentiation from competitors
- Objection handling ("How is this different from other agencies?")

## Supporting Testimonial

> "I received so much feedback and guidance and a whole lot of value on a FREE call... I am looking forward to learning more from them as they are both amazing guides in their areas of expertise." — Holtzberg Luiza
