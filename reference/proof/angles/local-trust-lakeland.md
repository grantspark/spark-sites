# Angle: Local Trust / Lakeland Roots

## The Hook

"We're Lakeland people building for Lakeland businesses. Your success is our neighborhood."

## The Insight

Small business owners want to work with people who understand their world. A remote agency doesn't know that South Florida Avenue foot traffic matters, or that Cohatch is where local entrepreneurs connect, or that Southeastern University is a pipeline for talent and credibility. We're embedded in this community — not outsourced from across the country.

## Key Messages

- We live and work in Lakeland — your customers are our neighbors
- We understand the Central Florida market, not just "small business" in general
- Local reputation matters to us — we can't hide behind anonymity
- We show up in person — workshops, events, business groups
- Supporting local businesses is how communities thrive

## Proof Points

- Spark Sites based in Lakeland since 2018
- Free workshops at Cohatch Lakeland
- Nicole is a Professor at Southeastern University (local institution)
- Clients are real Lakeland businesses you can visit
- Word-of-mouth referrals within the local business community

## Use In

- Geo-targeted ads (Lakeland, Polk County, Central Florida)
- Google Ads with local intent keywords ("Lakeland web design")
- Community event promotion
- Differentiating from remote/national agencies

## Supporting Testimonial

> "I connected with them at a workshop they did at the Cohatch in Lakeland on Social Media and Marketing (which was absolutely amazing)." — Holtzberg Luiza

## Awareness Level

**Solution-aware.** They know they need a web designer or marketer. The question is who — and "local and trustworthy" is the deciding factor.
