## Colors

### Four dominant palette families — pick one

**Family 1 — Navy + Orange** (HVAC, multi-trade, general contractor — most common)
- Primary: `#1c3d6b` (navy)
- CTA / accent: `#FF5A09` (burn orange)
- Secondary blue: `#1561ad`
- Background: `#ffffff` / sections: `#f1f0ee`
- Dark sections: `#2c2c2c`

**Family 2 — Red + White** (plumbing, roofing, emergency services)
- Primary: `#c53211` (service red)
- CTA / accent: `#ff3a22`
- Background: `#ffffff` / sections: `#f5f5f5`
- Dark sections: `#393939`

**Family 3 — Deep Teal + Gold** (established local businesses, premium positioning)
- Primary: `#2d545e` (night teal)
- CTA / accent: `#ce9e62` (rusted gold)
- Background: `#ffffff` / sections: `#fef6dd`
- Dark sections: `#12343b`

**Family 4 — Muted Blue-Gray + White** (residential cleaning, comfort-focused)
- Primary: `#6B7A8F` (slate)
- CTA / accent: `#1561ad` (blue)
- Pale accent: `#c2dde6`
- Background: `#ffffff` / sections: `#f7f7f7`

**2026 emerging differentiator — Earthy Neutrals** (clay, forest, mocha)
- Clay red: `#de493c` / Forest green: `#608074` / Rusted gold: `#ce9e62`
- Currently rare in the industry — strong differentiation opportunity

### Colors to avoid
- Purple in any dominant role — reads feminine/tech/beauty, not contractor
- Pastels — signals spa or children's products
- Neon or fluorescent tones — cheap template association
- Pure black dominant backgrounds — reads as tech startup, not local service
- More than 3 dominant colors — signals no brand identity
- Generic mid-level teal as primary — too healthcare-adjacent

## Typography

### Display / heading fonts (pick one)
- **Oswald Bold** — condensed, authoritative, Hook Agency's top recommendation for home services
- **Montserrat ExtraBold** — geometric, modern professional, most common in industry
- **Bebas Neue** — all-caps, maximum impact, best for emergency-forward services
- **Anton** — thick strokes, commanding, good for 24/7 urgency positioning
- **Raleway Bold** — slightly more refined, approachable authority
- **Arvo Bold** — slab serif, craft and durability signal (for heritage positioning)

### Body fonts (pick one)
- **Roboto** — industry default, clean, reliable
- **Open Sans** — slightly warmer, excellent readability
- **Lato** — warmest option, best for residential cleaning / handyman

### Proven pairings
| Display | Body | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Oswald Bold | Open Sans | Trustworthy, utilitarian — widest use case |
| Montserrat ExtraBold | Roboto | Modern professional, most common |
| Bebas Neue | Lato | High-impact, urgency-forward |
| Raleway Bold | Open Sans | Clean, elevated, approachable |
| Arvo Bold | Lato | Heritage, craft-focused |

### Size conventions
- H1 hero: 48–72px desktop, 32–42px mobile, always bold
- Body: 16–18px minimum — never below 15px
- Phone number in header: matches or exceeds H2 — the single most important typographic element
- CTA button text: 16–20px, bold

## Photography

### Primary subjects
1. Technician in branded uniform working — under a sink, on a roof, at a control panel. Working, not posing.
2. Branded vehicle parked at a residential home — van + neighborhood communicates local operation + professionalism simultaneously
3. Full team photo — staff in matching uniforms in front of vehicles — signals scale and accountability
4. Owner or lead technician headshot — named face creates personal accountability
5. Before and after job documentation — real results
6. Happy homeowner in their actual home (lived-in, not staged)

### Hero image pattern
- **Authority pattern** (emergency services): technician in uniform + branded vehicle, direct eye contact — used by Mr. Rooter, Carter Services, Lion Home Service
- **Outcome pattern** (scheduled/comfort services): family relaxed in comfortable home — used by Alpine HVAC

### Mood
- Bright natural daylight
- Warm residential interiors — kitchens, utility rooms, basements
- Confident and calm expressions — not theatrical urgency, not glossy commercial smiling
- Warm-neutral color temperature — not cold industrial blue

### What to avoid
- Stock photos of models in tool belts — homeowners recognize immediately, conversion-killing
- Unbranded crew — plain shirt with no logo offers zero trust signal
- Extreme close-ups of pipes/wiring with no human — clinical and disconnected
- Dark or dramatically lit photos — implies emergency and fear
- Empty luxury interiors with no technician — renovation portfolio, not service company

---

## Layout conventions

### Hero structure
- H1: service + location or core benefit ("Expert Plumbing Contractors in Lakeland, FL")
- Subhead: 1–2 sentences max
- Primary CTA: "Book Online" or "Get a Free Estimate" — large, high-contrast, above the fold
- Phone number: H1 scale, clickable tel:// link — most important element on mobile
- Social proof: "4.9 stars — 1,900+ Google Reviews" with platform logo
- No rotating carousel — homeowners decide in 3 seconds, slides 2–5 never seen

### Homepage section order
1. Sticky nav — logo left, nav center, phone + "Book Now" right (persistent on scroll)
2. Hero
3. Service tiles — 4–8 clickable categories with icons, self-select navigation
4. Trust stats — "50 Years / 100,000+ Customers / 500,000+ Jobs"
5. Why Choose Us — 4–6 icons: Licensed & Insured, Background-Checked, Same-Day, Upfront Pricing, 24/7
6. Reviews carousel — full text, customer name, date, star icons, platform logo
7. Team / company photo — real staff, branded uniforms
8. Coupons / offers — "$50 off AC Repair" not "Great Deals Available"
9. Service list — expandable by category
10. Service area — named cities and neighborhoods (specificity = credibility)
11. FAQ — accordion: How much? How soon? Are you licensed?
12. Secondary CTA
13. Footer — physical address, hours, license number, BBB, social, privacy

### CTA button copy that converts
- "Book Online" / "Schedule Service" / "Get a Free Estimate" / "Request Service Today"
- Avoid: "Submit," "Click Here," "Learn More," "Get Started"

### Trust signal hierarchy
1. Google review aggregate (stars + count + logo) — above the fold
2. Years in business + specific job/customer volume
3. Google Guaranteed badge
4. BBB A+ / HomeAdvisor Screened badges
5. Manufacturer certifications (Carrier, Lennox, Trane for HVAC)
6. State contractor license number
7. "Locally owned and operated" with owner name

## Tone
- Direct, not clever — homeowners under pressure need info fast
- Specific over general — "We fix burst pipes, clogged drains, and water heater failures — same day"
- Numbers over adjectives — "50 years, 1,900+ reviews" beats "long-established, highly rated"
- Short sentences, active verbs — "We arrive same-day" not "Same-day arrival is available"

### Words that convert
Trust: reliable, dependable, honest, trusted
Competence: expert, certified, licensed, trained
Speed: same-day, 24/7, emergency, fast response
Safety: licensed, insured, bonded, background-checked
Fairness: upfront pricing, flat rate, no hidden fees
Local: locally owned, your neighbors, serving [city] since [year]

### Words to avoid
Revolutionary, innovative, passionate, world-class, best-in-class, boutique, holistic approach — all misaligned with trade services
