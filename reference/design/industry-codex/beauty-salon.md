## Colors

### Four dominant palette archetypes — pick one

**Archetype A — Luxury Neutral / Editorial** (upmarket, women 30–50, established salon)
- Background: `#FAF7F2` (warm ivory)
- Surface/sections: `#F5F0EB` (soft cream)
- Text: `#2C2C2C` (charcoal — not pure black)
- Mid-tone: `#C8B8A2` (greige/taupe)
- Accent: `#C9A96E` (muted gold)
- Alternate accent: `#E8D5B0` (champagne)

**Archetype B — Blush / Rose Feminine** (boutique, younger female demographic, romantic)
- Background: `#FDFAF8` (near-white)
- Surface/sections: `#F2D9D0` (blush rose)
- Accent 1: `#D4A5A0` (dusty rose)
- Accent 2: `#B08A8A` (muted mauve)
- Text: `#3A2E2E` (warm dark brown)
- Metallic: `#B76E79` (rose gold)

**Archetype C — High-Contrast Monochrome** (fashion-forward, unisex, avant-garde)
- Background: `#FFFFFF` (pure white)
- Text: `#0A0A0A` (ink black)
- Dividers: `#E8E8E8` (light gray)
- Single pop accent: deep forest green, burgundy, or cobalt (varies by brand)
- Metallic: `#C0C0C0` (chrome silver)
- Note: relies entirely on photography for warmth — requires exceptional images

**Archetype D — Earth / Organic / Botanical** (wellness, organic, sustainable positioning)
- Background: `#F0E8D8` (warm sand)
- Accent 1: `#C4825A` (terracotta)
- Accent 2: `#8B9E7A` (sage green)
- Text: `#3B2A1A` (espresso brown)
- Surface: `#E8DDD0` (linen)

### The 60-30-10 rule (industry standard)
- 60% — dominant neutral (background, large sections)
- 30% — secondary hue (panels, section backgrounds, imagery frames)
- 10% — accent (CTA buttons, icon highlights, thin rule lines)

### Colors to avoid
- Bright red — signals urgency/stress/discounts, not luxury service
- Neon or saturated colors (electric blue, lime, hot pink) — reads as bargain brand
- Pure bright white alone — sterile, clinical, medical office feel
- Purple used generically — overused in amateur beauty branding, reads as stereotype
- Random multi-color combinations — number-one amateur signal
- Lime green or teal as primary — spa-adjacent, hard to sell luxury hair against

## Typography

### Display / heading fonts

**Tier 1 — Luxury Editorial Serifs** (H1, hero headlines, section titles)
- **Playfair Display** — high contrast, elegant, strong at large sizes — most common in industry
- **Cormorant Garamond** — refined, fashion-forward, narrow proportions — highest-end option
- **Bodoni Moda** — extreme contrast, Vogue-era editorial — H1 only, very decorative
- **DM Serif Display** — more accessible version, reads at smaller sizes, works for H2/H3

**Tier 2 — Approachable Serifs** (boutique/friendly positioning)
- Libre Baskerville — warmer, less fashion-cold
- Lora — extremely readable at small sizes

### Body / utility fonts
- **Lato** — warm, humanist, approachable — most common body font in industry
- **Montserrat** — geometric, slightly editorial — good for nav, subheadings, buttons
- **Inter** — neutral, highly readable at small sizes
- **Raleway** — elegant, fashion-adjacent — good for nav labels and subheadings

### Proven pairings
| Display | Body | Positioning |
|---|---|---|
| Playfair Display | Lato | Most common — sophisticated and warm, safe choice |
| Cormorant Garamond | Raleway | Highest-end luxury, very editorial |
| Cormorant Garamond | Lato | Clean luxury, widely used |
| DM Serif Display | Inter | Modern luxury, readable |
| Bodoni Moda | Josefin Sans | Maximum editorial, Vogue-coded |

### Typography rules
- Body minimum: 16px — never below
- H1 display: 48–80px (hero headings often 60px+)
- Line height: 1.5–1.6 body, 1.1–1.2 large display headings
- Letter spacing: display serifs often +0.02–0.05em tracking for elegance
- Max 2 typeface families — never mix two serifs
- Avoid script fonts in body copy, light-weight body text, more than 2 families

## Photography

### Subjects (in order of impact)
1. Hero: single dominant portrait — close-up of finished hair in excellent lighting, three-quarter turn. Subject is the HAIR, not the face.
2. Process shots: stylist at work — hands on hair, coloring in progress, blow-dry moment
3. Salon interior: empty chair, reception, product shelves — aspirational space photography
4. Team portraits: individual stylists, consistent background + lighting across all
5. Before-and-after pairs: side-by-side or slider format — highest-trust content on site. Technique labeled (balayage, keratin, color correction) with stylist credited
6. Close-up texture shots: hair shine, wave pattern, color depth — works as section backgrounds

### Mood and style
- Warm, directional lighting — soft window light or studio key light with fill
- Clean, uncluttered backgrounds — white seamless, neutral gray, or salon interior
- Consistent color grading across all images — reads as one cohesive shoot
- Slight film-grain or matte finish — prevents the "cheap stock photo" oversaturation
- Model focus on the hair result, not the face

### What to avoid
- Oversaturated, heavy HDR processing
- Mixed lighting temperatures across a single gallery (some warm, some cool)
- Stock photos of models who are clearly not salon clients (too perfect, too staged)
- Phone photos in poor light
- Inconsistent cropping and framing across gallery
- Before-and-afters where the "before" has bad lighting — undermines the result
- Generic iStock beauty photos — universally recognized as fake, seen on 50 other sites

### If real photography isn't available
- Editorial stock libraries (Stocksy, Unsplash beauty collections) — editorial feel, not commercial
- Never: standard iStock or Getty beauty stock

## Layout conventions

### Hero patterns
- **Pattern A — Full-width image + centered overlay text**: most common, large single hero portrait with headline and "Book Now" CTA
- **Pattern B — Split layout (50/50 or 60/40)**: left text/CTA, right portrait — editorial feel, excellent on desktop
- **Pattern C — Full-screen video loop**: muted salon process video behind headline — high-impact, requires significant photography investment
- **Pattern D — Minimal text-first**: no hero image, large typographic headline on monochrome background — high-end only, requires recognized brand name

### Standard section order
1. Nav bar — logo left, nav center/right, "Book Now" button far right (accent color, always visible)
2. Hero — dominant image, headline, primary CTA
3. Social proof strip — "5-star rated on Google" + review count, or press logos
4. Services overview — 3–6 categories with icon or image, short description, pricing link
5. About / Meet the team — salon story, owner photo, 2–3 sentence brand promise
6. Gallery / portfolio — grid of 6–12 images, before/after capability
7. Testimonials — 3 featured reviews, client name, photo if possible, Google embed
8. Team profiles — photo, name, title, specialties, individual booking link
9. Location + hours — embedded map, address, hours
10. Footer CTA — repeat "Book Now", contact info, social links

### CTA strategy
- One primary CTA: "Book Now" or "Book an Appointment" — always visible
- Placed: nav bar (persistent), hero, after each service description, footer
- Button: accent color (gold, rose, or contrasting tone) — never same as background or body text
- Text: action-oriented and specific — "Book Your Visit" beats "Click Here"

### Trust signal placement
- Above fold / hero: star rating badge ("Rated 4.9 on Google — 500+ Reviews"), award badges
- Below first scroll: press/feature logos, pull-quote testimonials
- Throughout: before-and-after gallery with technique labels, stylist certifications in bios
- Footer: professional association memberships, Google Business rating

## Tone and feel

### Words that signal credibility
Polished, unhurried, confident, intimate, artisanal, refined, welcoming, expert (without jargon)

### Words to avoid
- "Affordable" / "Cheap" / "Budget" — implies low-end positioning
- "Fast" — implies rushing clients
- "One-stop shop" — breadth over depth signals amateur
