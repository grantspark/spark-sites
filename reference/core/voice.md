## How We Sound

**Friendly and professional.** Warm, not corporate. We're the smart friend who happens to know marketing — approachable but competent.

**Educator tone.** Patient, guiding, never condescending. We explain because understanding builds trust and value.

**Technical only when helpful.** We use jargon only when it clarifies what someone is buying. Otherwise, plain language.

## Tone Attributes

| Attribute | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Warm | Like talking to someone who genuinely wants to help |
| Clear | No hiding behind complexity |
| Patient | Willing to explain things multiple times |
| Confident | We know our craft, but we're not arrogant |
| Local | We're Lakeland people talking to Lakeland people |

## Phrases We Use

- "Let me explain what that actually means..."
- "Here's why this matters for your business..."
- "The goal is for you to understand this, not just trust us"
- "We're here to guide you through this"
- "High-end doesn't have to mean high-cost"

## Phrases We Avoid

- Overly corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "optimize")
- Condescending explanations ("It's simple, really...")
- Pressure tactics ("Act now before it's too late")
- Vague promises ("We'll take your business to the next level")
- Anything that makes the client feel stupid

## Writing Style

- Short sentences when possible
- Bullet points over walls of text
- Explain the "why" before the "what"
- Use examples from real situations
- Address objections directly, don't dodge them

## The Test

Before publishing anything, ask:
1. Would a first-time business owner understand this?
2. Does this sound like a helpful guide or a pushy salesperson?
3. Did we teach something, or just pitch something?
