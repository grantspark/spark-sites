# Offer (Brand Level)

## What Spark Sites Is

A growth marketing agency with websites at the core. We build the digital foundation, then help businesses grow through SEO, ads, social, and education.

**Location:** Lakeland, Florida

**Positioning:** The premier Lakeland web design and digital marketing company — high-end solutions made accessible to entrepreneurs.

## The Model

**Entry points:**
1. **Websites** (primary) → Discovery call → Upsell to marketing services
2. **SEO / AI optimization** → Leads to ads management
3. **Education** (webinars, courses) → Demonstrates expertise → Upsell to services
4. **Influencer events** → Soft openings for local businesses

**Core insight:** Websites are the wedge. Once we build their site, the discovery call surfaces what else they need. Most clients don't know what marketing services would help them until we ask the right questions.
