# Offer (Brand Level)

## What Spark Is

Your growth partner. We combine strategy, education, and execution to help small businesses grow — not just get a deliverable. Websites, SEO, ads, social, and AI are tools we use. The partnership is the product.

**Location:** Lakeland, Florida

**Positioning:** The growth partner for entrepreneurs who want high-end marketing with real understanding — not just a vendor who disappears after the invoice.

## The Model

**Entry points:**
1. **Starter Site** → Live demo on cold call → Hosting client → Discovery call → Growth partnership
2. **Websites** (direct) → Discovery call → Ongoing growth partnership
3. **SEO / AI optimization** → Leads to broader marketing services
4. **Strategy sessions** → Direct entry for businesses that need direction first
5. **Education** (webinars, courses) → Demonstrates expertise → Partnership
6. **Influencer events** → Soft openings for local businesses

**Core insight:** The partnership is the model. Some clients enter through a website, others through a strategy session, others through education. Every entry point leads to the same place — an ongoing growth relationship where we strategize, execute, and educate together.
