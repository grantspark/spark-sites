# Audience

## Who We Serve

Small business owners and entrepreneurs in Central Florida — particularly Lakeland and the surrounding area. People who want professional digital presence but don't have enterprise budgets or in-house marketing teams.

## Primary Segments

### The Local Business Owner
- Runs a physical location (retail, restaurant, service)
- Needs a website but doesn't know where to start
- Has been burned by cheap freelancers or overpriced agencies
- Wants someone who understands Lakeland and local business

### The Growing Entrepreneur
- Has a working business, ready to scale
- Knows they need marketing but overwhelmed by options
- Looking for a trusted guide, not a vendor
- Values understanding what they're paying for

### The Female Founder
- Female entrepreneur, founder, or small business owner ages 25-45
- Building something real — often solo or with a tiny team
- Juggling operations, marketing, and client delivery simultaneously
- Has tried DIY tools (Wix, Squarespace, Canva) but knows she's outgrowing them
- Wants a professional digital presence that matches the quality of her work
- Values partnership over being sold to — wants to understand, not just trust

### The Event Host
- Opening a new location or launching something
- Wants buzz and foot traffic
- Interested in influencer marketing but doesn't know the landscape
- Needs someone to handle the networking and logistics

## Pains

- "I know I need a website but I don't know what I actually need"
- "I've wasted money on marketing that didn't work"
- "Agencies talk over my head and I don't know what I'm paying for"
- "I don't have time to learn all this myself"
- "I can't afford what the big agencies charge"

## Desires

- A professional online presence that reflects their quality
- Marketing that actually brings in customers
- Understanding what's happening with their money
- A partner who explains things, not a vendor who disappears
- Confidence that they're making smart decisions

## Objections

- "Is this really worth the investment?"
- "Can't I just do this myself with Wix/Squarespace?"
- "How do I know this will actually work?"
- "I've been burned before by agencies"
- "I don't understand all this technical stuff"
