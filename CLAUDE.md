### Sales Pipeline (Demo Drop + Prospect Pro)

These two skills power the Spark Sites cold outreach pipeline. They live in the `demo-drop` repo (linked via `additionalDirectories` in `.claude/settings.local.json`).

**`/prospect-pro`** — Scans Google Maps for businesses in Polk County with no/weak digital presence. Returns 5 qualified leads, pushes approved ones to ClickUp (Spark Sites Sales list).

**`/demo-drop`** — Takes any lead (from Prospect Pro, ClickUp, or manual) and builds a live demo website via v0 API, deploys to Netlify. Show up to the cold call with proof.

**Config:** All agency settings (geography, industries, Netlify slug, GitHub org, ClickUp list) live in `demo-drop.config.yaml` in the demo-drop repo.

**Bridge links:** Skill discovery requires bridge copies at `.claude/skills/prospect-pro/` and `.claude/skills/demo-drop/` (gitignored). If these are missing, recreate them:
```bash
cp -r ~/Documents/GitHub/demo-drop/.claude/skills/prospect-pro .claude/skills/
cp -r ~/Documents/GitHub/demo-drop/.claude/skills/demo-drop .claude/skills/
```
